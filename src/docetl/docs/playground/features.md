# Features

The DocETL playground provides an interactive environment for building and testing document processing pipelines. Here are the key features:

## Current Features

### Hybrid Interface
The playground offers a unique hybrid between a notebook and spreadsheet interface, allowing you to:
- Iteratively develop and test pipeline operations
- Inspect operation outputs in a tabular format
- Seamlessly switch between code and data views

### Performance Optimizations
To ensure responsive interaction:
- Smart sampling of large datasets for quick iteration
- Automatic caching of operation results
- Efficient handling of LLM API calls

### Output Management
- Add notes and highlights to important outputs
- Save and organize findings during pipeline development
- Track key insights and results

### Export Capabilities
- Export results from any operation to CSV
- Preserve intermediate results for further analysis
- Share outputs with team members

## Upcoming Features

We're actively working on several exciting ideas:

### Natural Language Pipeline Assistant
- Generate and indirectly modify pipelines using natural language
- Interactive help for pipeline development

### Enhanced Validation UI
- Per-document retry capabilities for failed operations
- UI support for gleaning validation outside of extra kwargs
- Visual feedback for validation results

### Pipeline Optimization Interface
- Interactive tools for optimizing operation performance
- Visual pipeline analysis and bottleneck identification
- Suggestions for pipeline efficiency improvements
