TRUMP,\n*\n*\nDefendant.\n*\n*\nGOVERNMENT'S MOTION FOR IMMUNITY DETERMINATIONS\nThe defendant asserts that he is immune from prosecution for his criminal scheme to\noverturn the 2020 presidential election because, he claims, it entailed official conduct. Not so.\nAlthough the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme\nwas fundamentally a private one. Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant\nacted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit,\nthe government function by which votes are collected and counted-a function in which the\ndefendant, as President, had no official role. In Trump v. United States, 144 S. Ct. 2312 (2024),\nthe Supreme Court held that presidents are immune from prosecution for certain official conduct-\nincluding the defendant's use of the Justice Department in furtherance of his scheme, as was\nalleged in the original indictment-and remanded to this Court to determine whether the remaining\nallegations against the defendant are immunized. The answer to that question is no. This motion\nprovides a comprehensive account of the defendant's private criminal conduct; sets forth the legal\nframework created by Trump for resolving immunity claims; applies that framework to establish\nthat none of the defendant's charged conduct is immunized because it either was unofficial or any\npresumptive immunity is rebutted; and requests the relief the Government seeks, which is, at\nbottom, this: that the Court determine that the defendant must stand trial for his private crimes as\nwould any other citizen.\n\nPage 2:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 2 of 165\nThis motion provides the framework for conducting the \"necessarily factbound\" immunity\nanalysis required by the Supreme Court's remand order. Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2340. It proceeds\nin four parts.\nSection I provides a detailed statement of the case that the Government intends to prove at\ntrial. This includes the conduct alleged in the superseding indictment, as well as other categories\nof evidence that the Government intends to present in its case-in-chief. This detailed statement\nreflects the Supreme Court's ruling that presidential immunity contains an evidentiary component,\nid., which should be \"addressed at the outset of a proceeding,\" id. at 2334.\nSection II sets forth the legal principles governing claims of presidential immunity. It\nexplains that, for each category of conduct that the Supreme Court has not yet addressed, this Court\nshould first determine whether it was official or unofficial by analyzing the relevant \"content,\nform, and context,\" id. at 2340, to determine whether the defendant was acting in his official\ncapacity or instead \"in his capacity as a candidate for re-election.\" Blassingame v. Trump, 87 F.4th\n1, 17 (D.C. Cir. 2023). Where the defendant was acting \"as office-seeker, not office-holder,\" no\nimmunity attaches. Id. (emphasis in original). For any conduct deemed official, the Court should\nnext determine whether the presumption of immunity is rebutted, which requires the Government\nto show that \"applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no 'dangers of intrusion on\nthe authority and functions of the Executive Branch.\"\" Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2331-32 (quoting\nNixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 754 (1982)).\nSection III then applies those legal principles to the defendant's conduct and establishes\nthat nothing the Government intends to present to the jury is protected by presidential immunity.\nAlthough the defendant's discussions with the Vice President about \"their official responsibilities\"\nqualify as official, see Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2336, the Government rebuts the presumption of\n- 2 -\n\nPage 3:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 3 of 165\nimmunity. And all of the defendant's remaining conduct was unofficial: as content, form, and\ncontext show, the defendant was acting in his capacity as a candidate for reelection, not in his\ncapacity as President. In the alternative, if any of this conduct were deemed official, the\nGovernment could rebut the presumption of immunity.\nFinally, Section IV explains the relief sought by the Government and specifies the findings\nthe Court should make in a single order-namely, that the defendant's conduct set forth in Section\nI is not immunized, and that as a result, the defendant must stand trial on the superseding\nindictment and the Government is not prohibited at trial from using evidence of the conduct\ndescribed in Section I.\nI.\nFactual Proffer\nWhen the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay\nin office. With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate\nplans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost-Arizona, Georgia,\nMichigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin (the \"targeted states\"). His efforts\nincluded lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing\nfraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R.\nPence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress's certification of the election by\nusing the defendant's fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6, 2021,\ndirecting an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional\ncertification. The throughline of these efforts was deceit: the defendant's and co-conspirators'\nknowingly false claims of election fraud. They used these lies in furtherance of three conspiracies:\n1) a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and\ncounts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA);\n2) a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results\n- 3 -\n\nPage 4:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 4 of 165\nof the presidential election; and 3) a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote\nand have their votes counted.\nAt its core, the defendant's scheme was a private criminal effort. In his capacity as a\ncandidate, the defendant used deceit to target every stage of the electoral process, which through\nthe Constitution, ECA, and state laws includes the states' notification to the federal government\nof the selection of their representative electors based on the popular vote in the state; the meeting\nof those electors to cast their votes consistent with the popular vote; and Congress's counting of\nthe electors' votes at a certification proceeding. As set forth in detail below, the defendant worked\nwith private co-conspirators, including private attorneys\nCC1\nCC2\nCC3\nand\nCC5\nand private political operatives\nCC6\nand\nP1\nThe defendant also relied heavily on private agents, such as his Campaign employees and\nvolunteers, like Campaign Manager\nP2\nDeputy Campaign Manager\nP3\nSenior Campaign Advisor\nP4\nand Campaign operative\nP5\nIn this section, the Government sets forth detailed facts supporting the charges against the\ndefendant, 1 before addressing in the next section why none of this conduct is subject to immunity\nunder the Supreme Court's decision in Trump. The conduct set forth below includes the\ndefendant's formation of the conspiracies leading up to and immediately following the 2020\npresidential election; certain information regarding his knowledge that there had not been\noutcome-determinative fraud in the election as he persistently claimed; and his increasingly\ndesperate efforts to use knowingly false claims of election fraud to disrupt the electoral process.\n1 Section I represents the Government's efforts to provide the Court and the defendant with all of\nthe categories of evidence that it may offer in its case-in-chief at trial. It does not include citations\nto every potential exhibit, nor does it account for any additional evidence that may be developed\nbefore trial.\n- 4 -\n\nPage 5:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 5 of 165\nThe Government does not consider any of the following conduct to be subject to immunity for the\nreasons set forth in Section III.\nA. Formation of the Conspiracies\nAlthough his multiple conspiracies began after election day in 2020, the defendant laid the\ngroundwork for his crimes well before then. Leading into the election, the defendant's private and\nCampaign advisors, including\nP6\n(then a private citizen) and\nP2\n(the defendant's\nCampaign manager), informed him that it would be a close contest and that it was unlikely to be\nfinalized on election day-in part because of the time needed to process large numbers of mail-in\nballots prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic.2 They also told the defendant that the initial returns\non election night might be misleading-that is, that he might take an early lead in the vote count\nthat would diminish as mail-in ballots were counted because his own supporters favored in-person\nvoting, while supporters of his opponent, Joseph R. Biden, favored mail-in ballots.3\nPrivately, the defendant told advisors-including\nP6\nCampaign personnel,\nP7\n(a White House staffer and Campaign volunteer), and\nP8\n(the Vice President's\nChief of Staff)-that in such a scenario, he would simply declare victory before all the ballots were\ncounted and any winner was projected.4 Publicly, the defendant began to plant the seeds for that\nfalse declaration. In the months leading up to the election, he refused to say whether he would\naccept the election results, insisted that he could lose the election only because of fraud, falsely\n2 GA 501-510\n); GA 591-599\n); GA 246-\n247\n3 GA 501-512\n); GA 591-599\n); GA 246-\n249\n); GA 132-153\n4 GA 505-507\nGA 250-255\nGA 588-589\n- 5 -\n\nPage 6:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 6 of 165\nclaimed that mail-in ballots were inherently fraudulent, and asserted that only votes counted by\nelection day were valid. For instance:\n\u00b7 In an interview on July 19, 2020, when asked repeatedly if he would accept the results\nof the election, the defendant said he would \"have to see\" and \"it depends.\"5\n\u00b7 On July 30, despite having voted by mail himself earlier that year, the defendant\nsuggested that widespread mail-in voting provided cause for delaying the election,\ntweeting, \"With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020\nwill be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a\ngreat embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely\nand safely vote ??? \"6\n\u00b7 In an interview on August 2, the defendant claimed, without any basis, that \"[t]here is\nno way you can go through a mail-in vote without massive cheating.\"7\n\u00b7 At a campaign event in Wisconsin on August 17, the defendant told his supporters,\n\"[t]he only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged, remember\nthat. It's the only way we're going to lose this election, so we have to be very careful.\"8\n\u00b7 In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on August 24, the\ndefendant said that \"[t]he only way they can take this election away from us is if this is\na rigged election.\"9\n\u00b7 On October 27, during remarks regarding his campaign, the defendant said, \"[i]t would\nbe very, very proper and very nice if a winner were declared on November 3rd, instead\nof counting ballots for two weeks, which is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe\nthat that's by our laws. I don't believe that. So we'll see what happens.\"10 The\ndefendant said this despite or perhaps because his private advisors had informed\nhim that it was unlikely that the winner of the election would be declared on\nNovember 3.\n5 GA 1968 at 37:20 (Video of Trump Interview with Chris Wallace 07/19/2020).\n6 See https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1288818160389558273 (Donald J.

Three days\nbefore election day,\nP1\ndescribed the defendant's plan to a private gathering of supporters:\n\"And what Trump's going to do is just declare victory. Right? He's going to declare victory.\nThat doesn't mean he's the winner, he's just going to say he's the winner.\"11 After explaining that\nBiden's supporters favored voting by mail,\nP1\nstated further, \"And so they're going to have\na natural disadvantage and Trump's going to take advantage of it-that's our strategy. He's going\nto declare himself a winner.\"12\nImmediately following election day on November 3, the defendant did exactly that. As his\nprivate and Campaign advisors had predicted to him, in certain states, the defendant took an early\nlead on election day that began to erode. At approximately 11:20 p.m., Fox News projected that\nBiden would prevail in the state of Arizona, and according to Campaign advisor\nP4\nhe and the\ndefendant were shocked and angry at this development.13 As election day turned to November 4,\nthe contest was too close to project a winner, and in discussions about what the defendant should\nsay publicly regarding the election, senior advisors suggested that the defendant should show\nrestraint while counting continued. 14 Two private advisors, however, advocated a different course:\nCC1\nand\nCC6\nsuggested that the defendant just declare victory.15 And at about 2:20 a.m.,\nthe defendant gave televised remarks to a crowd of his campaign supporters in which he falsely\n11 GA 1886 at 0:00\n12 Id. at 0:20\n).\n13 GA 376-380 at 70-74 (\n14 GA 600-602\n); GA 610-614\n); GA 380-\n383\n); GA 128-130\n); GA 161\nGA 370\n15\nGA 154\nGA 600\n); GA 181-182\n- 7 -\n\nPage 8:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 8 of 165\nclaimed, without evidence or specificity, that there had been fraud in the election and that he had\nwon: \"This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were\ngetting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this election.\"16\nIn the immediate post-election period, while the defendant claimed fraud without proof,\nhis private operatives sought to create chaos, rather than seek clarity, at polling places where states\nwere continuing to tabulate votes. For example, on November 4,\nP5\na Campaign employee,\nagent, and co-conspirator of the defendant-tried to sow confusion when the ongoing vote count\nat the TCF Center in Detroit, Michigan, looked unfavorable for the defendant. There, when a\ncolleague at the TCF Center told\nP5\n\"We think [a batch of votes heavily in Biden's favor is]\nright,\"17\nP5\nresponded, \"find a reason it isnt,\" \"give me options to file litigation,\" and \"even\nif itbis [sic].\"18 When the colleague suggested that there was about to be unrest reminiscent of the\nBrooks Brothers Riot, 19 a violent effort to stop the vote count in Florida after the 2000 presidential\nelection,\nP5\nresponded, \"Make them riot\" and \"Do it !!! \"20 The defendant's Campaign\noperatives and supporters used similar tactics at other tabulation centers, including in Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania,21 and the defendant sometimes used the resulting confrontations to falsely claim\n16 GA 1974 at 7:44 (Video of White House Speech 11/04/2020).\n17 GA 968-996\n18 Id.\n19 Id.\n20 Id.\n21 GA 997-999\n- 8 -\n\nPage 9:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 9 of 165\nthat his election observers were being denied proper access, thus serving as a predicate to the\ndefendant's claim that fraud must have occurred in the observers' absence.22\nContrary to the defendant's public claims of victory immediately following election day,\nhis advisors informed him that he would likely lose. On November 7, in a private Campaign\nmeeting that included\nP2\nP3\nP4\nand White House staffer\nP9\nwho came\nto serve as a conduit for information from the Campaign to the defendant, Campaign staff told the\ndefendant that he had only a slim chance of prevailing in the election, and that any potential success\nwas contingent on the defendant winning all ongoing vote counts or litigation in Arizona, Georgia,\nand Wisconsin.23 Within a week of that assessment, on November 13, the defendant's Campaign\nconceded its litigation in Arizona24-meaning that based on his Campaign advisors' previous\nassessment, the defendant had lost the election.\nThat same day, in an implicit acknowledgment that he had no lawful way to prevail, the\ndefendant sidelined the existing Campaign staff responsible for mounting his legal election\nchallenges. From\nP2\nP3\nand others who were telling the defendant the truth that he did\nnot want to hear-that he had lost-the defendant turned to\nCC1\n, a private attorney who was\nwilling to falsely claim victory and spread knowingly false claims of election fraud.\nAs the defendant placed alternating phone calls to\nP3\nand\nCC1\nthroughout\nNovember 13,25\nP1\ninformed\nCC6\nanother private Campaign advisor, of the change,\nwriting, \"Close hold don't tell anyone Trump just fired\nP3\nand put CC1\nin charge\" and\n22\nGA\n774-775\n(Donald\nJ.\nTrump\nTweet\n11/06/2020);\nGA\n776,\nhttps://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325194709443080192\n11/07/2020).\n(Donald J.\nTrump\nTweet\n23 GA 155-158\n24 GA 1001 (Donald J.

The Defendant Knew that His Claims of Outcome-Determinative Fraud Were\nFalse\nFollowing election day and throughout the charged conspiracies, the defendant, his co-\nconspirators, and their agents spread lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the\nelection and that he had actually won. These lies included dozens of specific claims that there had\nbeen substantial fraud in certain states, such as that large numbers of dead, non-resident, non-\ncitizen, or otherwise ineligible voters had cast ballots, or that voting machines had changed votes\nfor the defendant to votes for Biden. And the defendant and co-conspirators continued to make\nthese unsupported, objectively unreasonable, and ever-changing claims even after they had been\npublicly disproven or after advisors had directly informed the defendant that they were untrue.\nThe evidence demonstrates that the defendant knew his fraud claims were false because he\ncontinued to make those claims even after his close advisors-acting not in an official capacity\nbut in a private or Campaign-related capacity-told him they were not true. These advisors\n26 GA 1004\n27 Id.\n28 GA 784-785 (Donald J.

For instance, when the defendant told\nP9\nthat he was going to put\nCC1\nin charge of the Campaign's legal efforts but\nP9\ntold the defendant he would never have to pay\nanything;32 in response, the defendant laughed and said, \"we'll see.\"33 Thereafter,\npay him only if he succeeded,\nCC1\nin Oval Office meetings with the defendant,\nCC1\nand others, in which\nCC1\nmade\nspeculative claims,\nP9\ntold\nCC1\n-in front of the defendant-that\nCC1\n29 GA 699\n30 GA 671\n).\n31 GA 672-673; GA 686 (\n32 GA 205\n33 Id.\nP9\n- 11 -\n\nPage 12:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 12 of 165\nwould be unable to prove his allegations in a courtroom.34\nIn a separate private\nconversation, when\nP9\nreiterated to the defendant that\nCC1\nwould be unable\nto prove his false fraud allegations in court, the defendant responded, \"The details don't\nmatter.\">35\n\u00b7 In the post-election period,\nP9\nalso took on the role of updating the defendant on\na near-daily basis on the Campaign's unsuccessful efforts to support any fraud claims.36\nP9\ntold the defendant that the Campaign was looking into his fraud claims, and\nhad even hired external experts to do so, but could find no support for them. He told the\ndefendant that if the Campaign took these claims to court, they would get slaughtered,\nbecause the claims are all \"bullshit.\"37\nP9\nwas privy in real time to the findings\nof the two expert consulting firms the Campaign retained to investigate fraud claims-\nC1\nand\nC2\nand discussed with the defendant their\ndebunkings on all major claims.\n'38\nFor example,\nP9\nGeorgia's audit disproved claims that\nC3\ntold the defendant that\nhad altered votes. 39\nIn the post-election time period, Pence-the defendant's own running mate, who he had\ndirected to assess fraud allegations-told the defendant that he had seen no evidence of outcome-\ndeterminative fraud in the election. 40 This was in one of the many conversations the defendant\nand Pence had as running mates, in which they discussed their shared electoral interests. Pence\ngradually and gently tried to convince the defendant to accept the lawful results of the election,\neven if it meant they lost. These conversations included:\n. A conversation on November 4 in which the defendant asked Pence to \"study up\" claims\nof voter fraud in states that they had won together in 2016 to determine whether they could\nbring legal challenges as candidates in those states.41 Pence described the conversation as\nfollows: \"Well, I think, I think it was broadly. It was just look at all of it. Let me know\nwhat you think.

A call between the defendant and Pence on November 7, the day that media organizations\nbegan to project Biden as the winner of the election. Pence \"tried to encourage\" the\ndefendant \"as a friend,\" reminding him, \"you took a dying political party and gave it a new\nlease on life.\"43\n\u00b7 A November 11 meeting among the defendant, Pence, Campaign staff, and some White\nHouse staff during which Pence asked when most of the lawsuits would be resolved (\"when\ndoes this come to a head?\") and the Campaign staff responded, the \"week after\nThanksgiving.\">44\n. A November 12 meeting among the defendant, Pence, Campaign staff, and some White\nHouse staff during which, Pence recalls, the \"Campaign lawyers gave a sober and\nsomewhat pessimistic report on the state of election challenges. \">45\n. A private lunch on November 12 in which Pence reiterated a face-saving option for the\ndefendant: \"don't concede but recognize process is over.\"46\n. A private lunch on November 16 in which Pence tried to encourage the defendant to accept\nthe results of the election and run again in 2024, to which the defendant responded, \"I don't\nknow, 2024 is so far off.\"47\n.

You still have to fight like hell.\"54\nThe defendant and his co-conspirators also demonstrated their deliberate disregard for the\ntruth-and thus their knowledge of falsity-when they repeatedly changed the numbers in their\nbaseless fraud allegations from day to day. At trial, the Government will introduce several\ninstances of this pattern, in which the defendant and conspirators' lies were proved by the fact that\nthey made up figures from whole cloth. One example concerns the defendant and conspirators'\nclaims about non-citizen voters in Arizona. The conspirators started with the allegation that 36,000\nnon-citizens voted in Arizona;55 five days later, it was \"beyond credulity that a few hundred\nthousand didn't vote\";56 three weeks later, \"the bare minimum [was] 40 or 50,000. The reality is\nabout 250,000\";57 days after that, the assertion was 32,000;58 and ultimately, the conspirators\nlanded back where they started, at 36,000-a false figure that they never verified or corroborated.59\nUltimately, the defendant's steady stream of disinformation in the post-election period\nculminated in the speech he gave at a privately-funded, privately-organized rally at the Ellipse on\nthe morning of January 6, 2021, in advance of the official proceeding in which Congress was to\ncertify the election in favor of Biden. 60 In his speech, the defendant repeated the same lies about\n(Wisconsin Elections Commission web page 11/05/2020); GA 1077-1081 (Wisconsin Elections\nCommission web page 11/10/2020); GA 1082-1087 (Wisconsin Elections Commission web page).\n54 GA 308\n55 GA 1890 at 20:46 (Common Sense with\n11/25/2020).\n56 GA 1906 at 2:06:25 (Video of Arizona Hotel Hearing 11/30/2020).\n57 GA 1980 at 18:52\n58 GA 1981 at 35:19\n59 GA 1106 (Dalton Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/04/2021); GA 1134 (Ellipse Rally Speech Draft Tr.\n01/06/2021).\n60 GA 1114-1141 (Ellipse Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/06/2021); GA 1142\n- 15 -\n\nPage 16:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 16 of 165\nelection fraud in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin that had been\npublicly, or directly, debunked.61 The defendant used these lies to inflame and motivate the large\nand angry crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol and disrupt the certification\nproceeding. 62\nC. The Defendant Aimed Deceit at the Targeted States to Alter Their Ascertainment\nand Appointment of Electors\nShortly after election day, the defendant began to target the electoral process at the state\nlevel by attempting to deceive state officials and to prevent or overturn the legitimate ascertainment\nand appointment of Biden's electors. As President, the defendant had no official responsibilities\nrelated to the states' administration of the election or the appointment of their electors, and instead\ncontacted state officials in his capacity as a candidate. Tellingly, the defendant contacted only\nstate officials who were in his political party and were his political supporters, and only in states\nhe had lost. The defendant's attempts to use deceit to target the states' electoral process played\nout in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as across these\nand other states that used certain voting machines. In addition to the following evidence of the\ndefendant's conduct during the charged conspiracies, at trial the Government will elicit testimony\nfrom election officials from the targeted states to establish the objective falsity-and often,\nimpossibility-of the defendant's fraud claims. Notably, although these election officials would\nhave been the best sources of information to determine whether there was any merit to specific\nallegations of election fraud in their states, the defendant never contacted any of them to ask.\n61 GA 1126-1129, GA 1131-1136 (Ellipse Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/06/2021).\n62 GA 1140 (Ellipse Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/06/2021).\n- 16 -\n\nPage 17:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 17 of 165\n1. Arizona\nThe defendant was on notice that there was no evidence of widespread election fraud in\nArizona within a week of the election. On November 9, for instance, two days after news networks\nprojected that Biden had won, the defendant called Arizona Governor\nP16\nto ask him\nwhat was happening at the state level with the presidential vote count in Arizona.63 At that point,\nthough Fox News had projected that Biden had won the state, several other news outlets-\nincluding ABC, NBC, CNN, and the New York Times-had not yet made a projection. 64\nP16\nwalked the defendant through the margins and the votes remaining to be counted, which were\nprimarily from Pima County, which favored Biden, and Maricopa County, which was split. 65\nP16\ndescribed the situation to the defendant as \"the ninth inning, two outs, and [the defendant]\nwas several runs down.\"66 The defendant also raised claims of election fraud, and\nP16\nasked\nthe defendant to send him supporting evidence. 67 Although the defendant said he would-stating,\n\"we're packaging it up\"-he never did.68 Shortly thereafter, on November 13, Campaign Manager\nP2\ntold the defendant directly that a false fraud claim that had been circulating-that a\n63 GA 656-658\n; GA 727 (\n64 See, e.g., Democrats flip Arizona as Biden, Kelly score key election wins, Fox NEWS, Nov. 3,\n2020, available at https://www.foxnews.com/video/6206934979001; Dan Merica, Biden carries\nArizona, flipping a longtime Republican stronghold, CNN.COM, Nov. 13, 2020, available at\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/11/12/politics/biden-wins-arizona/index.html; Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurni et\nal., Biden flips Arizona, further cementing his presidential victory, N.Y.

On November 30,\nCC1\nP12\nand others arrived in Arizona for\na \"hotel hearing\"-an unofficial meeting with Republican legislators-during which they\npromoted false fraud allegations. 83 In a meeting the day after the hearing, when state legislators\npressed\nCC1\nand P12\nfor evidence to support their claims,\nCC1\nconceded that even on that\nlate date, \"[w]e don't have the evidence, but we have lots of theories.\"84\nWhen the legislators were\nfrustrated that\nCC1\nhad no support for his claims and asked him tough questions,\nCC1\nexpressed surprise at the way he was being treated, stating \"Man, I thought we were all\n77 GA 735\n); GA 21-22 (\n78 See GA 30\n79 GA 22-24\n80 GA 28\n81 GA 22-33\n82 GA 25\n83 GA 1906 at 56:19 (Video of Arizona Hotel Hearing 11/30/2020).\n84 GA 36\n- 19 -\nthe Speaker of the\ndefendant and\nCC1\n\nPage 20:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 20 of 165\nRepublicans.\n[T]his is a little more hostile a reception.

Voting Machines in Multiple States\nThroughout the post-election period, the defendant and co-conspirators repeatedly made\nclaims about the security and accuracy of voting machines across multiple states, despite the fact\nthat they were on notice that the claims were false. As early as November 12, for instance, the\nNational Association of Secretaries of State, the National Association of State Election Directors,\nand other coordinated federal, state, and private entities issued a public statement declaring that\nthe 2020 election was \"the most secure in American history\" and that there was \"no evidence that\nany voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\"212\nOn November 14, in the Tweet announcing that\nCC1\nwas to lead his Campaign legal\nefforts, the defendant also named\nCC3\na private attorney who was fixated on voting machine\nclaims, and\nP10\nanother private attorney.213\nTwo days later, on November 16, on the\ndefendant's behalf, executive assistant\nP42\nsent\nCC3\nand other private attorneys an email,\ntitled \"From POTUS,\" attaching a document containing bullet points critical of\nC3\na company that manufactured voting machines used in certain states, and writing, \"See\nattached - Please include as is, or almost as is, in lawsuit.\"214\nCC3\nresponded nine minutes later,\nwriting, \"IT MUST GO IN ALL SUITS IN GA AND PA IMMEDIATELY WITH A FRAUD\nCLAIM THAT REQUIRES THE ENTIRE ELECTION TO BE SET ASIDE in those states and\nmachines impounded for non-partisan professional inspection.\"215\nOn November 17,\nP50\nthe director of the Department of Homeland Security's\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), publicly tweeted that a group of private\n212 GA 1236 (Election Security Joint Statement 11/12/2020).\n213\nGA 784-785 (Donald J.

He further stated, \"[b]ut she never sent us any evidence, despite a\nlot of requests, polite requests. Not a page. When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to\nstop contacting her.

She is also not a lawyer for the President in his personal capacity.\"226\nNonetheless, the defendant continued to support and publicize\nCC3\nknowingly false claims.\nFor example, within days of\nCC1\nstatement, the defendant promoted a lawsuit that\nCC3\nwas about to file, tweeting on November 24, \"BREAKING NEWS: @\nCC3\nsays her\nlawsuit in Georgia could be filed as soon as tomorrow and says there's no way there was anything\nbut widespread election fraud. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #Dobbs.\"227\nCC3\nfiled a lawsuit the next\nday against the Governor of Georgia falsely alleging \"massive election fraud\" accomplished\n222 GA 258-259\n223 GA 256-259\n).\n224 GA 258-260\n225 GA 206\n226 GA 1241 (Trump Campaign Statement 11/22/2020).\n227 GA 815-816 (Donald J.

And the DHS and\nDOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven't seen anything to substantiate that.\"239\nCC1\nand P12\nimmediately issued a formal Campaign statement attacking\nP52\nand the Justice\nDepartment, writing, \"With all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn't been any\nsemblance of a Department of Justice Investigation . . . his opinion appears to be without any\nknowledge or investigation of the substantial irregularities and evidence of systemic fraud.\"240\nIn mid-December, the defendant spoke with RNC Chairwoman\nP39\nand asked her to\npublicize and promote a private report that had been released on December 13 that purported to\nidentify flaws in the use of\nC3\nmachines in Antrim County, Michigan. 241\nP39\nrefused, telling the defendant that she already had discussed the report with\nP38\nMichigan's\nSpeaker of the House, who had told her that the report was inaccurate. 242\nconveyed to\nP39\nthe defendant\nP38\nexact assessment: the report was \"fucking nuts.\"243\nOn January 2, during the defendant's call with Georgia Secretary of State\nP33\nsaid of false claims regarding voting machines, \"I don't believe that you're really\nquestioning the\nC3\nmachines.

And the defendant and co-conspirators' efforts to overturn the legitimate vote\ncount through a pressure campaign on state officials, and through false claims made directly to\nstate legislators in formal or pseudo-hearings, continued to fail. So in early December, the\ndefendant and his co-conspirators developed a new plan regarding the targeted states that the\ndefendant had lost (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and\nWisconsin): to organize the people who would have served as the defendant's electors had he won\nthe popular vote, and cause them to sign and send to Pence, as President of the Senate, certifications\nin which they falsely represented themselves as legitimate electors who had cast electoral votes\nfor the defendant. Ultimately, the defendant and his co-conspirators would use these fraudulent\nelectoral votes-mere pieces of paper without the lawful imprimatur of a state executive-to\nfalsely claim that in his ministerial role presiding over the January 6 certification, Pence had the\nauthority to choose the fraudulent slates over the legitimate ones, or to send the purportedly\n\"dueling\" slates to the state legislatures for consideration anew.\nThe fraudulent elector plan's arc and obstructive purpose is reflected in a series of\nmemoranda drafted in late November and early December by\nCC5\nan attorney who\nvolunteered to assist the defendant's Campaign in lawsuits challenging the election in\nWisconsin. 249 Beginning with a memorandum drafted on November 18,\nCC5\nadvocated that\nthe defendant's elector nominees in Wisconsin meet and cast votes on the date required by the\nECA (in 2020, December 14) in the event that an ongoing recount in the state reversed the\ndefendant's loss there. 250 But this course of action-which\nCC5\nWisconsin memorandum\n249\nGA 1245-1246\nGA 1247-1248\n250 GA 1249-1255\nCC5\nmemo 11/18/2020).\n- 48 -\n\nPage 49:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 49 of 165\npresented as a contingency plan to preserve the possibility that the defendant's electors' votes be\ncounted at the January 6 certification proceeding if he prevailed in the Wisconsin litigation and\nwon the state-quickly transformed into a corrupt strategy to overturn the legitimate election\nresults. 251\nCC5\nrevealed this obstructive plan in two additional memoranda, dated December\n6252 and December 9,253 which proposed that the defendant's elector nominees in six of the targeted\nstates-all but New Mexico, a state the defendant lost by more than ten percent of the popular\nvote, sparsely referenced in his false claims of voter fraud, and did not envision challenging at the\ninception of the elector scheme254_meet on December 14, sign fraudulent certifications, and send\nthem to the Vice President to manufacture a fake controversy during the January 6 congressional\ncertification.\nThe defendant personally set the fraudulent elector plan in motion in early December,\nensured that it was carried out by co-conspirators and Campaign agents in the targeted states, and\nmonitored its progress. By December 5, the defendant was starting to think about Congress's role\nin the election process; for the first time, he mentioned to Pence the possibility of challenging the\nelection results in the House of Representatives. 255 In the same call, Pence told the defendant that\nthe Georgia Bureau of Investigation was investigating their race.256\n251 GA 1256-1259\n252 GA 1260-1265\n253\nGA 1266-1270\nCC5\nCC5\nmemo 12/06/2020).\nmemo 12/09/2020).\n254 GA 1271\nCertificate of Ascertainment); GA 1273-1282\n1\n255\nGA 1283-1284\nGA 436-437\nGA 1019 (Pence, So Help Me God, p. 433).\n256\nGA 1283-1284\nGA 438-439\n); GA 1272 (New Mexico\n- 49 -\n\nPage 50:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 50 of 165\nOn December 6, the same day that\nCC5\nput the plan on paper, 257 the defendant and\nCC2\ncalled RNC Chairwoman\nP39\nout of the blue. 258\nP39\ndid not know\nCC2\nand the defendant introduced him to\nP39\nby saying that he was a professor and lawyer;\nthereafter,\nCC2\nwas the primary speaker during the conversation. 259\nCC2\ntold\nP39\nthat he and the defendant wanted the RNC \"to help the campaign assemble the electors in the states\nwhere we had legal challenges, or litigation that was ongoing . .. in case any of that litigation\nchanged the result of a state so that it would meet the constitutional requirement of electors\nmeeting.\"260\nWhen the call ended,\nP39\nimmediately called\nP3\none of the defendant's\ndeputy Campaign managers, and relayed her conversation with the defendant and\nCC2\n261\nAfter\nP3\nassured\nP39\nthat the Campaign was \"on it,\"\nP39\ncalled the defendant back\nand told him so.262 On the same day, from his personal email account,\nP21\nforwarded to\nCampaign staff\nCC5\nNovember 18 memorandum and wrote, \"We just need to have someone\ncoordinating the electors for states.\"263 And the following day, on the evening of December 7,\nCC1\nP39\nsent\na text message stating in part, \"I have lawyers assigned in each state\nworking on Dec 14 electors meeting and what they need.

At 1:42 a.m., the defendant posted on Twitter a copy of a report falsely alleging\nfraud and wrote, \". . . Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C.\non January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\"319\nWhen\nCC5\nlearned about the Tweet, he sent a\nlink about it to another of the Wisconsin attorneys who had met with the defendant in the Oval\nOffice on December 16 and wrote, \"Wow. Based on 3 days ago, I think we have unique\nunderstanding of this.\"320 Later on December 19, the defendant called Pence and told him of plans\nfor a rally on January 6 and said that he thought it would be a \"big day\" and good to have lots of\ntheir supporters in town. 321\nThe defendant and his co-conspirators recognized that Pence, by virtue of his ministerial\nrole presiding over the January 6 congressional certification, would need to be a key part of their\nplan to obstruct the certification proceeding.

So on January 6, the defendant sent to the Capitol a crowd of\nangry supporters, whom the defendant had called to the city413 and inundated with false claims of\noutcome-determinative election fraud, to induce Pence not to certify the legitimate electoral votes\nand to obstruct the certification. 414\nAt the Ellipse Campaign rally,\nCC1\nand\nCC2\nspoke just before the defendant.

For instance, he said, \"By the way,\nPennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn't know because it was so quick. They had a\nvote. They voted.

Send it\nback!\"429\nThe defendant gave his supporters false hope that Pence would take action to change the\nresults of the election and claimed that Pence had the authority to do so. He falsely told the crowd\nthat Pence could still \"do the right thing\"430 and halt the certification, and he extemporized lines\nabout the Vice President through the speech, including the indirect threat, \"Mike Pence, I hope\nyou're gonna stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country.

Ct. at 2327, 2332, 2347. This section sets forth the applicable legal\nprinciples and then Section III applies them to the categories of conduct that the superseding\nindictment alleges and that the Government intends to prove at trial in order to demonstrate that\nnone of the defendant's conduct is immunized.\nIn Trump, the Supreme Court announced the principles that govern a former President's\nclaim of constitutional immunity from federal criminal prosecution. The Supreme Court divided\npresidential acts into three categories: (1) core presidential conduct that Congress has no power to\nregulate and for which a former President has absolute immunity; (2) other official presidential\nacts for which the President has at least presumptive immunity; and (3) unofficial conduct for\n494 GA 1705-1709\n495\nGA 1925 at 19:14, 20:34 (Video of Congress Joint Session 01/06/2021); GA 1704 at 41\n(Congressional Record 01/06/2021).\n- 85 -\n\nPage 86:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 86 of 165\nwhich the President has no immunity. Id. at 2327, 2331-32. With respect to the first category of\ncore official conduct, when the President's authority to act is \"'conclusive and preclusive,\"\"\nCongress may not regulate his actions, and the President has absolute immunity from criminal\nprosecution. Id. at 2327 (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 638\n(1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)). Applying those principles to the original indictment, the\nSupreme Court concluded that the defendant is \"absolutely immune from prosecution for the\nalleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials\" and his \"threatened\nremoval of the Acting Attorney General.\" Id. at 2335. The superseding indictment omits those\nallegations, and the Supreme Court did not find that any other conduct alleged in the original\nindictment implicated \"conclusive and preclusive\" presidential authority. See id. at 2335-40.\nThe threshold question here, then, is whether the defendant can carry his burden to establish\nthat his acts were official and thus subject to presumptive immunity. Id. at 2332; see Dennis v.\nSparks, 449 U.S. 24, 29 (1980) (noting that for immunity doctrines, \"the burden is on the official\nclaiming immunity to demonstrate his entitlement\"). Official conduct includes acts taken within\nthe \"'outer perimeter' of the President's official responsibilities, covering actions so long as they\nare 'not manifestly or palpably beyond [his] authority.\"\" Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2333 (quoting\nBlassingame, 87 F.4th at 13). But consistent with the D.C. Circuit's opinion in Blassingame, the\nSupreme Court suggested that a President who speaks \"as a candidate for office or party leader\"-\nas the defendant did here-does not act in his official, presidential capacity. Id. at 2340. As the\nD.C. Circuit explained, a President acting as a \"candidate for re-election\" is, to that extent, not\ncarrying out an official responsibility. Blassingame, 87 F.4th at 17; accord id. at 5 (\"When a\nsitting President running for re-election speaks in a campaign ad or in accepting his political party's\nnomination at the party convention, he typically speaks on matters of public concern. Yet he does\n- 86 -\n\nPage 87:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 87 of 165\nso in an unofficial, private capacity as office-seeker, not an official capacity as office-holder. And\nactions taken in an unofficial capacity cannot qualify for official-act immunity.\") (emphasis in\noriginal). To assess whether a presidential action constitutes an \"official\" act, courts must apply\nan \"objective analysis\" that focuses on the \"'content, form, and context\"\" of the conduct in\nquestion. Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2340 (quoting Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443, 453 (2011)). A\nPresident's motives for undertaking the conduct and the fact that the conduct is alleged to have\nviolated a generally applicable law are not relevant considerations. Id. at 2333-34.\nIf a President's actions constitute non-core official presidential conduct, he is at least\npresumptively immune from criminal prosecution for that conduct. 144 S. Ct. at 2328, 2331; id.\nat 2332 (reserving whether \"this immunity is presumptive or absolute ... [b]ecause we need not\ndecide that question today\"). The Government can overcome that presumptive immunity by\ndemonstrating that \"applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no 'dangers of intrusion\non the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.\"\" Id. at 2331-32 (quoting Fitzgerald, 457\nU.S. at 754). Just as the inquiry into whether conduct is official or unofficial is \"necessarily\nfactbound,\" Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2340, with \"[t]he necessary analysis [being] ... fact specific,\"\nid. at 2339, so too should be the inquiry into whether any \"presumption of immunity is rebutted\nunder the circumstances,\" id. at 2337. The analysis should first identify the specific alleged act at\nissue, and then determine whether criminal liability for the act intrudes on a relevant Executive\nBranch authority or function, taking care not to \"conceive[] of the inquiry at too high a level of\ngenerality.\" Banneker Ventures, LLC v. Graham, 798 F.3d 1119, 1141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (reversing\ndistrict court in civil immunity case). Such an approach recognizes that Executive authority has\nlimits-boundaries imposed by constitutional text, the separation of powers, and precedent-and\nthat application of criminal law to the President's official conduct does not per se intrude\n- 87 -\n\nPage 88:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 88 of 165\nimpermissibly on Executive Branch authority and functions. Cf. Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2327 (\"If\nthe President claims authority to act but in fact exercises mere 'individual will' and 'authority\nwithout law,' the courts may say so.\") (quoting Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 655 (Jackson, J.,\nconcurring)).\nThese principles for assessing whether the conduct alleged in the superseding indictment\nis immune apply equally to evidence. The Government may not introduce evidence of immunized\nofficial conduct against a former President at a trial, even to prove that the former President\ncommitted a crime predicated on unofficial conduct. Id. at 2340-41.\nIII.\nNone of the Allegations or Evidence Is Protected by Presidential Immunity\nAt its core, the defendant's scheme was a private one; he extensively used private actors\nand his Campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private\ncapacity as a candidate for office. To the limited extent that the superseding indictment and\nproffered evidence reflect official conduct, however, the Government can rebut the presumption\nof immunity because relying on that conduct in this prosecution will not pose a danger of intrusion\non the authority or functions of the Executive Branch. Below, the Government categorizes the\nconduct outlined in Section I and provides \"content, form, and context\" for this Court to determine\nthat the defendant's conduct was private or that, in the alternative, any presumptive immunity is\nrebutted \"under the circumstances.\" Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2337. This analysis is necessarily fact-\nintensive, and all of the Government's analysis below is based on the unique facts and\ncircumstances of this case.\nThis section first addresses the defendant's interactions with Pence, because in Trump, the\nSupreme Court held that when the defendant conversed with Pence about \"their official\nresponsibilities,\" the conduct was official. 144 S. Ct. at 2336. Accordingly, the Government\nexplains below why any presumptive immunity as to the defendant's official conduct regarding\n- 88 -\n\nPage 89:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 89 of 165\nPence is rebutted. Other than the specific official conduct related to Pence that the Supreme Court\nheld to be official, none of the defendant's other actions were official. This section categorizes\nthat conduct and provides the \"content, form, and context\" that establishes its unofficial nature.\nThese categories are: a) the defendant's interactions, as a candidate, with state officials; b) the\ndefendant's efforts, as a candidate, to organize fraudulent electors; c) the defendant's public\nspeeches, Tweets, and other public statements as a candidate; d) the defendant's interactions, as a\ncandidate, with White House staff; and e) other evidence of the defendant's knowledge and intent.\nLastly, even if these categories of conduct and evidence were to be deemed official, the\nGovernment can rebut the attendant presumption of immunity as described below.\nA. The Defendant's Interactions with Pence\nThe only conduct alleged in the original indictment that the Supreme Court held was\nofficial, and subject to at least a rebuttable presumption of immunity, was the defendant's attempts\nto lie to and pressure Vice President Pence to misuse his role as President of the Senate at the\ncongressional certification. The Supreme Court stated that \"[w]henever the President and Vice\nPresident discuss their official responsibilities, they engage in official conduct,\" and further\nexplained that because Pence's role at the certification was \"a constitutional and statutory duty of\nthe Vice President,\" the defendant was \"at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such\nconduct.\" 144 S. Ct. at 2336. Accordingly, unlike all of the other threshold determinations that\nthe Court will have to make about whether the defendant's conduct alleged in the superseding\nindictment was official, with respect to the defendant's conversations with Pence about Pence's\nofficial role at the certification proceeding, the Court can skip to the second step: whether the\nGovernment can rebut the presumption of immunity that the Supreme Court held applies to such\nconversations. Because the Executive Branch has no role in the certification proceeding-and\nindeed, the President was purposely excluded from it by design-prosecuting the defendant for his\n- 89 -\n\nPage 90:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 90 of 165\ncorrupt efforts regarding Pence poses no danger to the Executive Branch's authority or\nfunctioning.\nAs described below, the Government also intends to introduce at trial evidence regarding\nconversations between the defendant and Pence in which they did not discuss Pence's official\nresponsibilities as President of the Senate and instead acted in their private capacities as running\nmates. And the Government intends to elicit at trial evidence about a Pence staffer's conversations\nwith co-conspirator\nCC2\nThose conversations were unofficial and therefore not immune.\n1. The defendant's interactions with Pence as the President of the Senate were\nofficial, but the rebuttable presumption of immunity is overcome\nThe superseding indictment and the Government's trial evidence include the defendant's\nattempts to influence Pence's \"oversight of the certification proceeding in his capacity as President\nof the Senate.\" Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2337. These conversations included one-on-one conversations\nbetween the defendant and Pence (see, e.g., supra pp. 49, 63-65, 72-74, describing conversations\non December 5 and 25, 2020, and January 1, 3, 5, and 6, 2021496), as well as conversations in\nwhich the defendant included private actors, such as co-conspirator\nCC2\nin his attempts to\nconvince Pence to participate in the conspiracies (see, e.g., supra pp. 66-67 and 71-72, describing\nconversations on January 4 and 5, 2021).\nThe Supreme Court held that discussions between the defendant and Pence concerning\nPence's role at the certification proceeding qualify as official conduct, and therefore are subject to\n496 The Government's factual proffer also describes a conversation between the defendant and\nPence on December 19-the same day that the defendant issued his \"will be wild!\" Tweet calling\nsupporters to Washington-in which the defendant told Pence that it would be good to have lots\nof their supporters in town on January 6. See supra pp. 60. At trial, the Government intends to\nuse this unofficial portion of the conversation, held between running mates, but not Pence's\nresponse, which included a reference to the certification proceeding on January 6. GA 440-441\n); GA 1020 (Pence, So Help Me God p. 437). See infra p. 145-146.\n- 90 -\n\nPage 91:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 91 of 165\na rebuttable presumption of immunity, because they involved \"the President and the Vice President\ndiscuss[ing] their official responsibilities.\" Id. at 2336. Those discussions qualify as official\nbecause \"[p]residing over the January 6 certification proceeding at which Members of Congress\ncount the electoral votes is a constitutional and statutory duty of the Vice President.\" See id. at\n2336; U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 3, cl. 4. The discussions at issue did not pertain to Pence's role as\nPresident of the Senate writ large, however, but instead focused only on his discrete duties in\npresiding over the certification proceeding-a process in which the Executive Branch, by design,\nplays no direct role. Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2337. A prosecution involving the defendant's efforts\nto influence Pence in the discharge of this particular duty, housed in the Legislative Branch, would\nnot \"pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.\" Id.\nThe Executive Branch has no authority or function to choose the next President.\nBlassingame, 87 F.4th at 17. To the contrary, the Constitution provides that the States will appoint\nelectors to vote for the President and Vice President. U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2. And all States\nhave chosen to make such appointments based on the ballots cast by the people in their respective\nstates. See Chiafalo v. Washington, 591 U.S. 578, 581 (2020). \"The Congress may determine the\nTime of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes,\" U.S. Const. Art.\nII, \u00a7 1, cl. 4, but the Executive Branch has no direct role in that process. The next step in the\nprocess established by the Constitution similarly provides no role for the Executive Branch: the\nHouse and Senate meet in joint session, with the President of the Senate present to \"open all the\ncertificates\" of the state-appointed electors in the presence of the House and Senate, for them to\nbe counted. U.S. Const. Amend. XII. \"The person having the greatest number of votes for\nPresident, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors\nappointed.\" Id. Only if the state-appointed electors have failed to make a choice, i.e., no candidate\n- 91 -\n\nPage 92:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 92 of 165\nhas such a majority, does the choice fall to the House of Representatives, who, voting by state\ndelegation, \"choose immediately, by ballot,\" from the three presidential candidates receiving the\nmost electoral votes. Id. There, too, the Executive Branch plays no role in the process.\nThe exclusion of the Executive Branch reflects fundamental constitutional principles. The\n\"executive Power\" is \"vested in a President\" only for \"the Term of four Years,\" U.S. Const. Art.\nII, \u00a7 1, cl. 1, and it transfers to his successor, by operation of law, \"at noon on the 20th day of\nJanuary,\" U.S. Const. Amend. XX. Permitting the incumbent President to choose his own\nsuccessor-or, worse still, to perpetuate himself in power-would contradict the entire\nconstitutional system that the Framers created. \"In free Governments,\" Benjamin Franklin\nexplained, \"the rulers are the servants, and the people their superiors [and] sovereigns.\" 2 The\nRecords of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 120 (Max Farrand ed., 1911). A government could\nnot be considered a \"genuine republic,\" Madison argued, unless \"the persons administering it,\"\nincluding the President, \"be appointed, either directly or indirectly, by the people; and that they\nhold their appointments\" for a \"definite period.\" The Federalist No. 39 (J. Madison). Thus, while\nthe Framers recognized \"the necessity of an energetic Executive,\" they justified and checked his\npower by ensuring that he always retained \"a due dependence on the people.\" The Federalist No.\n70 (A. Hamilton); see Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 223-24 (2020). The Framers further\nrecognized that while regular elections would serve as \"the primary control on the government,\"\n\"experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions\" as well. The Federalist\nNo. 51 (J. Madison).\nSome of those precautions are reflected in the design of the Electoral College itself.\n\"[W]ary of 'cabal, intrigue, and corruption,\" the Framers \"specifically excluded from service as\nelectors 'all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the president in\n- 92 -\n\nPage 93:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 93 of 165\noffice.\"\" Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2339 (quoting The Federalist No. 68 (A. Hamilton)). They were\nkeenly aware, as Justice Story later explained, that \"an ambitious candidate\" could hold out \"the\nrewards of office, or other sources of patronage,\" in an effort \"to influence a majority of votes;\nand, thus, by his own bold and unprincipled conduct, to secure a choice, to the exclusion of the\nhighest, and purest, and most enlightened men in the country.\" Joseph Story, 3 Commentaries on\nthe Constitution of the United States \u00a7 1450, at 314 (1833 ed.). To guard against that possibility,\nArticle II provides that \"no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or\nProfit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.\" U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2. As a\nleading early American commentator observed, these limitations serve \"to prevent the person in\noffice, at the time of the election, from having any improper influence on his re-election, by his\nordinary agency in the government.\" See 1 James Kent, Commentaries on American Law *276\n(8th ed. 1854).\nThe Constitution's structure further reflects the Framers' considered choice to exclude the\nincumbent President from playing a role in choosing the next President. The Constitution reflects\nan abiding concern that governmental \"power is of an encroaching nature, and that it ought to be\neffectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it,\" not least to protect against \"the danger\nto liberty from the overgrown and all-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate.\" The\nFederalist No. 48 (J. Madison); see Metro. Wash. Airports Auth. v. Citizens for Abatement of\nAircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 273 (1991) (\"The abuses by the monarch recounted in the\nDeclaration of Independence provide dramatic evidence of the threat to liberty posed by a too\npowerful executive.\"). The Framers therefore designed a system of separated powers in part to\nensure that \"[n]o man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly\nbias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.\" The Federalist No. 10 (J. Madison).\n- 93 -\n\nPage 94:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 94 of 165\nThe defendant's charged conduct directly contravenes these foundational principles. He\nsought to encroach on powers specifically assigned by the Constitution to other branches, to\nadvance his own self-interest and perpetuate himself in power, contrary to the will of the people.\nAs such, applying a criminal prohibition to the defendant's conduct would not pose any danger of\nintrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch; rather, it would advance the\nConstitution's structural design to prevent one Branch from usurping or impairing the performance\nof the constitutional responsibilities of another Branch. See Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 699-\n702 (1997).\nHistory confirms that presidents have never understood their wide-ranging duties to\nencompass any direct role in the function of collecting, counting, and certifying the results of a\npresidential election. As President Lincoln explained in 1864, \"[b]y the Constitution and laws the\nPresident is charged with no duty in the conduct of a presidential election in any State,\" and \"[i]f\nany election shall be held, and any votes shall be cast in the State of Tennessee for President and\nVice President of the United States, it will belong, not to the military agents, nor yet to the\nExecutive Department, but exclusively to another department of the Government, to determine\nwhether they are entitled to be counted, in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United\nStates.\" 8 Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, 71-72 (1953). When Congress later sent to\nLincoln for his signature a \"Joint resolution declaring certain States not entitled to representation\nin the electoral college,\" Lincoln signed the resolution \"in deference to the view of Congress\nimplied in its passage and presentation to him,\" but \"disclaim[ed] all right of the Executive to\ninterfere in any way in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral votes.\" House Special\nCommittee, Counting Electoral Votes, H.R. Misc. Doc. No. 44-13, at 229-230 (1877). The\nGovernment is aware of no contrary evidence, including of any President, other than the defendant,\n- 94 -\n\nPage 95:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 95 of 165\nseeking to influence his Vice President in the discharge of his duties as President of the Senate in\npresiding over the joint session. The absence of any such historical tradition is reinforced by the\nfact that in 22 of the 59 certification proceedings the Vice President has not presided at all. See\nJoel K. Goldstein, The Ministerial Role of the President of the Senate in Counting Electoral Votes:\nA Post-January 6 Perspective, 21 U. N.H. L. REV. 369, 402 & App'x 1 (2023).\nWhen it comes to the certification proceeding specifically, not only has the President been\ndeliberately excluded from the process, but the Vice President's role, as President of the Senate,\nis highly circumscribed and ministerial in nature. The Twelfth Amendment gives the President of\nthe Senate no substantive role in determining how to count the votes of the electors appointed by\nthe states. Rather, it provides only that he \"shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of\nRepresentatives, open all the certificates,\" and then shifts to the passive voice: \"and the votes shall\nthen be counted.\" Nothing in the Constitution remotely suggests that the single individual serving\nas President of the Senate would have the momentous responsibility to decide which votes to count\nand how they should be counted. Indeed, as Pence himself explained on January 6, 2021, giving\nthe President of the Senate such a role \"would be entirely antithetical to the [Constitution's]\ndesign.\"497\nAnd, removing any possible doubt, \"Congress has legislated extensively to define the\nVice President's role in the counting of the electoral votes,\" Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2337 (citing 3\nU.S.C. \u00a7 15), and it has never provided any substantive role for the Vice President, instead\nassigning the resolution of disputes to the two Houses of Congress.498 Moreover, Congress has\n497 GA 1685 (Pence Dear Colleague Letter 01/06/2021).\n498\nLegislation confirming the ministerial nature of that role dates to the Electoral Count Act of\n1887, Pub. L. 49-90, 24 Stat. 373 (1887). See 3 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 15-18 (2020 ed.) (assigning all power\nto resolve vote-counting disputes to the two Houses of Congress, while assigning to the President\nof the Senate only the ministerial duties of \"presiding,\" \"preserv[ing] order,\" \"open[ing] .. . the\ncertificates,\" \"call[ing] for objections,\" and \"announc[ing] the state of the vote\" after receiving the\nresults from the tellers).\n- 95 -\n\nPage 96:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 96 of 165\nnow made explicit-echoing and reaffirming constitutional tradition and practice-that, with\nlimited exceptions of no relevance to this case, \"the role of the President of the Senate while\npresiding over the joint session shall be limited to performing solely ministerial duties,\" 3 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 15(b)(1). He \"shall have no power to solely determine, accept, reject, or otherwise adjudicate or\nresolve disputes over the proper certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors, the validity\nof electors, or the votes of electors.\" Id. \u00a7 15(b)(2).499 Because the Vice President's role is and\nhas always been ministerial, rather than substantive or discretionary, it is difficult to imagine an\noccasion in which a President would have any valid reason to try to influence it. As such,\ncriminalizing a President's efforts to affect the Vice President's role as the President of the Senate\noverseeing the certification of Electoral College results would not jeopardize an Executive Branch\nfunction or authority.\nCritically, applying a criminal prohibition to the discrete and distinctive category of official\ninteractions between the President and Vice President alleged in this case would have no effect-\nchilling or otherwise-on the President's other interactions with the Vice President that implicate\nExecutive Branch interests. The President would still be free to direct the Vice President in the\ndischarge of his Executive Branch functions, such as \"presid[ing] over ... cabinet meetings,\"\nengaging in \"diplomacy and negotiation,\" or performing any other presidential duties that the\nPresident chooses to delegate. See Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2336 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe President would likewise still be free to advise the Vice President on how to \"advance the\n499\nSection 15 of Title 3 was amended in the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022, Pub. L. 117-\n328, 136 Stat. 4459, 5237-40 (2022), in response to the defendant's conduct here, to eliminate any\ndoubt that the President of the Senate's role at the joint session is ministerial. And because the\nrebuttal analysis is necessarily prospective in nature, the current version of Section 15 supplies the\nrelevant measure, in this context, of \"the Vice President's role in the counting of electoral votes,\"\nTrump, 144 S. Ct. at 2337.\n- 96 -\n\nPage 97:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 97 of 165\nPresident's agenda in Congress,\" by casting tiebreaking votes on legislation or nominations. Id.\nat 2337. None of these legitimate Executive Branch functions would be chilled or affected at all.\nLastly, the fact that the defendant regularly included other private actors, such as his private\nattorney and co-conspirator\nCC2\nin some conversations to attempt to pressure Pence\n(Superseding Indictment, ECF No. 226 \"| 75-76; supra pp. 66-67, 71-72) strengthens the\nconclusion that prosecuting the defendant for his actions using\nCC2\nto help recruit Pence into\nthe conspiracies does not infringe on any Executive Branch authority or function. As set forth in\nSection I, private co-conspirators worked to schedule the January 4 meeting at which\nCC2\nP59\nwas invited to the\nattempted to pressure Pence. Although White House Counsel\nmeeting, when he arrived to attend, the defendant explicitly excluded him from it-meaning that\nthe only attorney attending the meeting for the defendant was\nCC2\nhis privately-retained\ncounsel. In\nP59\ntelling, when\nP59\narrived at the Oval Office for the meeting, the\ndefendant \"said words\n. indicating he didn't want me at the meeting.\"500 It is hard to imagine\nstronger evidence that conduct is private than when the President excludes his White House\nCounsel and only wishes to have his private counsel present.\nNext, the phone call on January 5 that the defendant and\nCC2\nmade to Pence,\nP58\nand\nP8\nwas the result of the private co-conspirators' failure to convince\nP58\nand\nP8\nto do\nas\nCC2\nurged in the meeting on the morning of January 5 that\nP58\nand\nP8\ntook at the\ndefendant's request. The defendant's decision to include private actors in the conversations with\nPence about his role at the certification makes even more clear that there is no danger to the\nExecutive Branch's functions and authority, because the\nCC2\nconversations had no bearing on\nany Executive Branch prerogative. Instead, all of this conduct objectively benefitted the defendant\n500 GA 120-121\n- 97 -\n\nPage 98:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 98 of 165\nin his private capacity as a candidate. The Court should therefore find the presumption of\nimmunity to be rebutted. And because the presumption is rebutted, any participant in the meeting\nor phone call-including Pence,\nP58\nand\nP8\ncan testify about it at trial.\n2. The defendant's interactions with Pence as a running mate were unofficial\nAt trial, as indicated supra pp. 12-14, the Government intends to introduce evidence of\nprivate phone calls or in-person meetings (which occasionally included Campaign staff) that the\ndefendant had with Pence in their unofficial capacities, as running mates in the post-election\nperiod. These conversations were not described in the original indictment nor analyzed by the\nSupreme Court in its opinion, nor are they described in the superseding indictment. In these\nconversations, the defendant and Pence discussed their electoral prospects, election-related\nlitigation, and the possibility of the defendant running again in 2024 if his legal challenges failed.\nFor example, Pence \"tried to encourage\" the defendant \"as a friend,\" when news networks\nprojected Biden as the winner of the election; on other occasions, softly suggested the defendant\n\"recognize [the] process is over\" even if he was unwilling to concede; and encouraged the\ndefendant to consider running for election again in 2024. Although the defendant and Pence\nnaturally may have touched upon arguably official responsibilities that were tangential to their\nelection prospects-for instance, whether the federal government should begin its logistical\ntransition to prepare for a different Administration501_the overall context and content of the\nconversations demonstrate that they were primarily frank exchanges between two candidates on a\nshared ticket, and the Government does not intend to elicit testimony about any peripheral\ndiscussion of arguably official responsibilities. See Blassingame, 87 F.4th at 17 (\"[A] President\n501 See, e.g., GA 1037\nGA 425-426\n). See GA 1018 (Pence, So Help Me God p. 432).\n- 98 -\n\nPage 99:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 99 of 165\nacts in a private, unofficial capacity when engaged in re-election campaign activity.\"); see also\nUnited States v. Helstoski, 442 U.S. 477, 488 n. 7 (1979) (in the Speech or Debate context, when\nan act contains both protected legislative components and non-protected components, the correct\ncourse is to \"excis[e] references to legislative acts, so that the remainder of the evidence would be\nadmissible\"). Together, these discussions show the defendant and Pence considering advice from\ntheir shared Campaign advisors, weighing electoral strategies, and grappling with their loss. Both\nmen had something to gain by winning re-election, making more notable the persistence of Pence's\nsuggestions on how to accept the results of the election without losing face.\nEven if the Court determines that these conversations were official, however, the\nGovernment can rebut the presumption of immunity because the use of this evidence poses no risk\nto Executive Branch prerogatives. The content of the conversations at issue-the defendant and\nPence's joint electoral fate and how to accept the election results-have no bearing on any function\nof the Executive Branch. See Blassingame, 87 F.4th at 4 (\"The Office of the Presidency as an\ninstitution is agnostic about who will occupy it next.\").\n3.\nP58\none-on-one interactions with\nCC2\nwere unofficial\nPence staffer\nP58\nalso participated in a January 5 meeting with\nCC2\nand\nP8\n(Superseding Indictment, ECF No. 226 | 78a; supra pp. 69-70) and on January 6 engaged in a\nlengthy email exchange with\nCC2\n(Superseding Indictment, ECF No. 226 | 99; supra p. 85).\nThese interactions were outside of the defendant's presence, and the latter was a series of emails.\nThese conversations were not official, within the meaning of Trump, since the defendant was not\ninvolved and did not otherwise direct\nP58\nactions, and because of the other information above\ndescribing\nCC2\ninherently private role.\n- 99 -\n\nPage 100:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 100 of 165\nB. The Defendant's Interactions, in his Capacity as a Candidate, with Officials in the\nTargeted States\n1. The interactions at issue were unofficial\nAt trial, the Government will introduce evidence that the defendant, in his capacity as a\ncandidate, contacted state elected officials to use false claims of election fraud to induce their\nassistance with the charged conspiracies at the point in the electoral process in which the states\nascertain electors. These communications included calls to\nP16\nthe Governor of Arizona; a\nmeeting with Michigan legislators at the White House; a call to\nP18\nthe Speaker of the Arizona\nState House; a call to\nP26\nthe Attorney General of Georgia; and a call to\nP33\nthe\nGeorgia Secretary of State. The contacts, sometimes in person and sometimes by phone, were part\nof a single course of conduct aimed at lying to and influencing these state officials to alter the\nresults of the election in the defendant's favor. In each conversation, the defendant raised false\nclaims of election fraud when pressing the state officials, often asking them to take steps to prevent\nor overturn the ascertainment of Biden's legitimate electors. And in each case, the state officials\ninformed the defendant that they had not seen the fraud he was claiming had occurred in their state.\nNotably, all of these elected officials were the defendant's fellow Republicans; he made no efforts\nto contact the equivalent individuals holding the same offices in Nevada, New Mexico,\nPennsylvania, or Wisconsin, all of whom were Democrats. Most importantly, as with the\ndefendant's plan regarding the fraudulent elector slates, as President, he had no official role in the\nprocess by which states appointed and ascertained their presidential electors. See 144 S. Ct. at\n2353 (Barrett, J., concurring) (\"The President has no authority over state legislatures or their\nleadership, so it is hard to see how prosecuting him for crimes committed when dealing with the\nArizona House Speaker would unconstitutionally intrude on executive power.\").

Calls to\nP16\n(supra pp. 17-18)\nThe defendant called\nP16\nthen the Governor of Arizona, on or about November 9.502\nThe defendant's call to\nP16\nwas unofficial and undertaken as a candidate. Throughout the call,\nthe defendant was engaged in partisan electioneering. His comments focused on the vote count in\nArizona in his particular race, and on the margins and allegations of fraud that could potentially\nbenefit him personally as a candidate.\nP16\nin turn, responded by giving the defendant his\nassessment of the defendant's electoral prospects in Arizona-prospects that were dim.503 The\ndefendant did not ask about the vote counts for, or claim fraud existed in, any race other than his\nown. And he raised fraud claims in this context-about whether he could still win Arizona-not\nin the larger context of election integrity. The defendant claimed that he would deliver evidence\nof election fraud to\nP16\nthen did not.504 The call was a surprise to\nP16\nand unusually short\nand to the point for the defendant, who usually liked to chat.505 In contrast, according to\nP16\nthis call contained little conversation or pleasantries and was solely focused on the vote count in\nthe Presidential race and the defendant's fraud claims. 506\nThis call must also be considered in the context of the conspirators' additional pressure\ncampaign on\nP16\nOn other occasions,\nCC1\ntried to reach\nP16\nbut\nP16\ndeclined to\n502 GA 656-658\nGA 727\n503 See GA 656-658\n).

Meeting with Michigan legislators (Superseding Indictment, ECF No. 226\n\" 36; supra pp. 31-34)\nThe defendant's November 20 Oval Office meeting with Michigan state legislators was\nprivate in nature. During the meeting, the defendant raised claims of election fraud in the state\nrelated specifically and only to his own election, and the legislators explained that the defendant\nhad lost not because of fraud but because he had underperformed with educated female voters. 510\nAlthough the meeting took place in the Oval Office-as did many unofficial Campaign meetings\nin which the defendant participated in the post-election period511 a close examination of all of\nthe other circumstances surrounding the meeting makes clear that it was a Campaign meeting.\n507\nGA 661\n508\nGA 658-659, 667-668\n509 GA 831-834 (Donald J.

Trump, 144 S.

For instance, in an apparent\nreference to individuals retained for his private lawsuit, the defendant claimed, \"We're going to\nhave an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants. But an accurate\nnumber will be given, but it's, it's in the fifties of thousands, and that's people that went to vote\nand they were told they can't vote because they've already been voted for.\"554 Some of his false\nclaims of fraud paralleled claims made in Campaign lawsuits, such as that of a substantial number\nof dead and non-resident voters-for example, in Trump v.

Even if the defendant's contacts with state officials were official, the\nGovernment can rebut the presumption of immunity\nAlthough the Supreme Court did not resolve the issue in Trump, it described the basis for\nconcluding that using the defendant's conduct of lying to and pressuring state officials to change\nthe legitimate vote in a criminal prosecution would not intrude on Executive Branch functions or\nauthority:\nIndeed, the Constitution commits to the States the power to \"appoint\" Presidential\nelectors \"in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.\" Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2;\nsee Burroughs v. United States, 290 U.S. 534, 544 (1934). \"Article II, \u00a7 1's\nappointments power,\" we have said, \"gives the States far-reaching authority over\npresidential electors, absent some other constitutional constraint.\" Chiafalo v.\nWashington, 591 U.S. 578, 588-589 (2020). By contrast, the Federal\nGovernment's role in appointing electors is limited. Congress may prescribe when\nthe state-appointed electors shall meet, and it counts and certifies their votes. Art.\nII, \u00a7 1, cls. 3, 4. The President, meanwhile, plays no direct role in the process, nor\ndoes he have authority to control the state officials who do. And the Framers, wary\nof \"cabal, intrigue and corruption,\" specifically excluded from service as electors\n\"all those who from situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the\npresident in office.\" The Federalist No. 68, at 459 (A. Hamilton); see Art. II, \u00a7 1,\ncl. 2.\n144 S. Ct. at 2339. Under the Constitution, the Executive Branch has no constitutionally assigned\nrole in the state-electoral process. To the contrary, the constitutional framework excludes the\nPresident from that process to protect against electoral abuses. See supra p. 93. Accordingly,\napplying federal criminal law to the defendant's use of fraud to interfere with electoral processes\ncarried out by the states does not intrude on Executive Branch authority or functions. Rather, it\nensures that the President's conduct remains consistent with the Constitution's allocation of that\nauthority to the States, while in no way impairing his ability to \"encourage [state officials] to act\n- 111 -\n\nPage 112:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 112 of 165\nin a manner that promotes the President's view of the public good.\" 144 S. Ct. at 2338. The\nPresident remains free, for instance, to urge state officials to institute measures to combat a\npandemic or make arrangements to provide emergency relief. This case does not remotely\nimplicate such official conduct. What neither the President nor any other candidate may do is\nfurther his private campaign for office by using fraudulent means to have state officials certify him\nas winner of a presidential election despite the will of the voters. Accordingly, applying criminal\npenalties to that conduct will not intrude on any Executive Branch authority or function.\nC. The defendant's efforts, as a candidate, to organize fraudulent electors\n1. The conduct at issue was unofficial\nThe defendant's conduct with respect to the elector scheme is inherently private, and not\nsubject to immunity. See 144 S. Ct. at 2353 n.2 (Barrett, J., concurring in part) (\"Sorting private\nfrom official conduct sometimes will be difficult-but not always. Take the President's alleged\nattempt to organize alternative slates of electors. In my view, that conduct is private and therefore\nnot entitled to protection.\"). The President of the United States has no official responsibilities\nrelated to the organization or voting of electors in the various states-by virtue of the Constitution,\nthat process takes place in the states according to the laws and procedures set forth by each state.\nSee U.S Const., Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2. At oral argument before the Supreme Court, the defendant\ninitially conceded that the plan to submit fraudulent electors directed by the defendant and\nCC1\nwas not official. Tr. of Oral Argument at 29-30; Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2338. The Government\nnonetheless sets forth here the context, form, and content of the defendant's private contacts with\nRNC Chairwoman\nP39\nin furtherance of the fraudulent elector plan because the defendant\nconversely suggested in the same oral argument that he will argue that those efforts were official.\nSee 144 S. Ct. at 2338.\n- 112 -\n\nPage 113:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 113 of 165\nThe defendant had two relevant contacts with\nP39\nfirst, he and co-conspirator\nCC2\nP39\ncalled\non December 6 to ask her to ensure that the effort was properly\ncoordinated (Superseding Indictment, ECF No. 226 | 53; supra p. 50), and second, on the evening\nof December 14,\nP39\nemailed the defendant through his executive assistant,\nP42\nto\ninform him that the fraudulent electors had cast votes as he had directed (Superseding Indictment,\nECF No. 226 | 66; supra p. 57).\nThe defendant and\nCC2\ncall to\nP39\non December 6 was private. The defendant\nplaced the call along with\nCC2\na private attorney and co-conspirator, to\nP39\nthe\nChairwoman of a political organization whose objective was to elect a broad set of Republicans at\nthe federal and state level, including the defendant and other allied candidates. 560\nCC2\nwas\nacting in his capacity as a private attorney for the defendant; on the same day,\nCC2\nemailed\nwith several other private attorneys and wrote, \"This is huge - and hugely important. Let's make\nsure the various state electors are aware of the absolute necessity of meeting on the 14th, casting\ntheir votes, and otherwise complying with the transmittal requirements of federal law.\"561 Finally,\nthe content of the call was likewise unofficial. The defendant and\nCC2\nasked\nP39\nto\nwork with the Campaign, to ensure that the fraudulent electors were properly organized, which she\nagreed to do-and did, as is clear from her further contacts with\nCC1\nand\nCC6\nregarding\nthe plan. 562\nP39\nemail to the defendant on December 14 was likewise a private communication;\nP39\nsimply forwarded the defendant an RNC communication summarizing the electoral vote\n560 GA 323-325\n561 GA 1716-1717\n562\nGA 323-325\nGA 1286-1287\n); GA 1326-1327\nGA 1288-1290\n- 113 -\n\nPage 114:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 114 of 165\nto inform him that the private task the defendant had given her was complete, and\nP42\nconfirmed that she had relayed the message by writing, \"It's in front of him!\"563 As discussed\ninfra pp. 145-147, when a White House staffer facilitates unofficial conduct by relaying private,\npolitical communications, the private action is not converted to an official one simply because an\nExecutive Branch aide helps carry it out.\n2. Even if the conduct were deemed official, the Government could rebut the\npresumption of immunity\nIn any event, even if the defendant's efforts to convene fraudulent electors could be\nconsidered official, the presumption would be rebutted because \"a President has no legal\nauthority-and thus no official capacity-to influence how the States appoint their electors,\" and\naccordingly, there is \"no plausible argument for barring prosecution of that alleged conduct.\"\nTrump, 144 S. Ct. at 2353 n.2 (Barrett, J., concurring in part). \"[W]hile Congress has a limited\nrole [in the appointment of Presidential electors], the President has none.\" Id. Accordingly,\napplying the criminal law to the defendant's \"alleged attempt to organize alternative slates of\nelectors,\" while properly viewed as prosecution for private conduct, see id., implicates no authority\nor functions of the Executive Branch-and therefore including such conduct in the defendant's\nprosecution poses no danger of intruding on Executive Branch authority or functions. No federal\nexecutive function is impaired by applying criminal law to the alleged conduct of privately\norganizing fraudulent slates of electors.\n563 GA 328-329\nGA 1483-1484 (\n- 114 -\n\nPage 115:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 115 of 165\nD. The Defendant's Public Speeches, Tweets, and Other Public Statements as a\nCandidate\n1. The statements at issue were unofficial\nMerely because the President is speaking to the public-even on \"matters of public\nconcern\"-does not automatically render the communication official. Blassingame, 87 F.4th at\n19-20. Instead, what matters is \"whether the President is speaking (or engaging in conduct) in an\nofficial capacity as office-holder or instead in an unofficial capacity as officer-seeker,\" id. at 19,\nas determined by \"content, form, and context,\" Trump, 144 S.

These communications included public Campaign\nspeeches, Tweets, and other public statements and comments. The defendant's communications\nthat the Government has alleged in the superseding indictment and described in Section I were all\nmade in his capacity as a candidate and are not official.\na.

The RNC paid for the event. 564\nThe White House's records, including the trip binder that White House staff prepared for\nthe event and that includes a schedule and manifests, further confirm the private nature of the\nDalton speech.565 The defendant was the only Executive Branch participant in the event-other\nattendees were federal and state elected officials, the Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party,\nand the founder of Bikers for Trump. 566 The trip binder included a Hatch Act disclaimer stating\nthat \"employees of the Federal Government may not use their official title or position when\nparticipating in a political event.\"567 Its description of the \"event\" to which the defendant was\ntraveling was \"Remarks at Victory Rally.\"568 Similarly, the Presidential Daily Diary from that day\ndescribes that \"[t]he President made remarks at the Georgia Senate Victory Rally.\"569\nThis\nnomenclature-the use of the phrase \"Victory Rally\"-is significant. \"Victory\" necessitates one\npolitical candidate or party defeating another, and rallies are the kinds of events that candidates\nhold to excite their supporters and garner votes.\n564 GA 1718-1724\n; GA 1725-1729\n); GA 1730-1732\nD; GA 1733-1736\n); GA 1743\n); GA 1744\n);\nGA 1741\n; GA 1745-1746\nGA 1747\n; GA 1739\n565 GA 1751-1755\n566 GA 1752\n567 Id.\n568 Id.\n569 GA 767\n- 116 -\n\nPage 117:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 117 of 165\nMoreover, the defendant's Campaign sent numerous fundraising emails before, during, and\nafter the speech, confirming the event's private nature.

The\nUnited States Secret Service, which is charged with the President's protection at all times, even\nduring unofficial events, considered the rally to be \"a campaign event.\"579\nThe rally was\ncompletely funded by a $2.1 million private donation by\nP65\na grocery chain heiress.580\nThis private funding, while not dispositive, is a strong indicator that the event was unofficial.\nP66\nthe rally organizer who had the most direct contact with the defendant, was an\nemployee of the defendant's Campaign until December 31, 2020, and after that, a private citizen. 581\nAnd in public statements since leaving office, the defendant has said repeatedly that he \"had\nnothing to do with\" the rally \"other than they asked me to make a speech.

Consistent with the Hatch Act's\nrequirement that officials within the Executive Branch (other than the President or Vice President)\nmust refrain from using their official authority for partisan political purposes, see 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7323(a)(1), on the morning of the rally, an email from White House photographer\nP67\non which\nP45\nwas copied, provided \"[a] reminder today is a political event.\"584\nLikewise, the defendant's White House speechwriting staff understood that the speech was a\npolitical, unofficial one and used their personal devices and personal email accounts to do most of\nthe drafting and fact-checking for the defendant's Ellipse speech, though some last revisions to the\nspeech on the morning of January 6 occurred over White House email. 585 And officials in the\nWhite House Counsel's Office who customarily reviewed the defendant's official remarks\npointedly did not review the Ellipse speech because it was an unofficial Campaign speech.586\nSimilarly, the White House website in the moments after the defendant's speech at the rally made\nno mention of it-instead, the official webpage touted official accomplishments like COVID\n583 GA 1827-1832\n584 GA 1833\n); GA 539\n585 See GA 636\n); GA 191-192\nGA 1834-1843\n); GA 1681\n586 GA 105\nGA 476-477\n- 120 -\n\nPage 121:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 121 of 165\nvaccines and peace in the Middle East.587 By contrast, the speech was advertised heavily by the\ndefendant's Campaign Twitter account, which also repeatedly posted clips of the event in progress\nand afterward. 588\nThe day-of logistics of the Save America Rally further indicate its private nature. No other\nExecutive Branch officials spoke. Instead, other speakers included WFAF officials, the\ndefendant's political allies, two U.S. Representatives, and the defendant's co-conspirators and\nprivate attorneys,\nCC1\nand\nCC2\n589\nMoreover, the defendant's appearance was consistent with a Campaign rally, not an official\nevent. The crowd at the rally consisted of the defendant's political supporters, who held signs and\nwore clothing bearing the defendant's Campaign slogans. 590\nAnd the manner in which the\ndefendant took the stage at the rally was also consistent with his Campaign rallies: instead of\nentering as a military band played Hail to the Chief, as he might at an official presidential event,\nthe defendant entered and exited the Ellipse speech to the songs he had used throughout his\nCampaign (Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" and the Village People's \"Y.M.C.A.\"591).\n587\nSee The White House Home Page (screenshot), WHITEHOUSE.GOV (Jan. 6, 2021)\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20210106154456/https:/www.whitehouse.gov/.\n588 GA 954 (Team Trump Facebook Post 01/06/2021); GA 955 (Team Trump Facebook Post\n01/06/2021); GA 956 (Team Trump Facebook Post 01/06/2021); GA 957 (Team Trump Tweet\n01/06/2021); GA 958 (Team Trump Tweet 01/06/2021); GA 959 (Team Trump Tweet\n01/06/2021); GA 960 (Team Trump Tweet 01/06/2021); GA 961 (Team Trump Tweet\n01/06/2021); GA 962 (Team Trump Tweet 01/06/2021); GA 963 (Team Trump Tweet\n01/06/2021).\n589 GA 1928 (Video of Ellipse Rally 01/06/2021).\n590\nSee GA 1913 (Video of Ellipse Rally 01/06/2021); GA 1908 (Video of Ellipse Rally\n01/06/2021).\n591\nCompare KJRH-TV Tulsa, President Trump arrives at White House, YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7u5obMd18A with GA 1928 at 3:28:50 and 4:42:55 (Video\nof Ellipse Rally 01/06/2021).\n- 121 -\n\nPage 122:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 122 of 165\nTellingly, the significant similarities with the defendant's Dalton Campaign speech592\nconfirm that the Ellipse speech593 delivered just two days later-was private, partisan\nelectioneering. The defendant covered many of the same topics and told many of the same lies\nabout fraud in only his election-in some cases, using the exact same words. For instance:\n. The defendant, as a candidate, falsely claimed he had won the election (Dalton at GA 1102:\n\"I ran two elections. I won both of them. Second one, much more successful than the\nfirst.\" Ellipse at GA 1115: \"I've been in two elections; I won them both, and the second\none I won much bigger than the first.\").\n. The defendant, as a candidate and the leader of a political party, implored political\nsupporters to pressure Pence (Dalton at GA 1090: \"I hope Mike Pence comes through for\nus, I have to tell you. I hope that our great Vice President, our great Vice President comes\nthrough for us. He's a great guy. Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him\nquite as much.\" Ellipse at GA 1116: \"I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope\nso. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.\").\n\u00b7 The defendant, as a candidate and the leader of a political party, attacked a fellow party\nmember who had been insufficiently subservient (Dalton at GA 1104: Georgia Governor\nP17\nwas an \"incompetent governor.\" Ellipse at GA 1125:\nP17\nwas \"one of the\ndumbest governors in the United States.\").\n\u00b7 The defendant, who in his capacity as a candidate had suffered personal legal defeats in his\nprivate, election-related litigation at the Supreme Court, attacked it (Dalton at GA 1095:\n\"I'm not happy with the Supreme Court. They are not stepping up to the plate. They're\nnot stepping up.\" Ellipse at GA 1125: \"I'm not happy with the Supreme Court. They love\nto rule against me.\").\n\u00b7 The defendant, as a candidate, made myriad false claims regarding fraud in the presidential\nelection, including:\nO\nArizona\nNon-citizens cast 36,000 votes (Dalton at GA 1106: \"In Arizona, more than\n36,000 votes were cast by non-citizens.\" Ellipse at GA 1134: \"Over 36,000\nballots were illegally cast by non-citizens.\"); and\n592 See GA 1088 (Dalton Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/04/2021).\n593 See GA 1114 (Ellipse Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/06/2021).\n- 122 -\n\nPage 123:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 123 of 165\n\" There were more ballots than voters (Dalton at GA 1106: \"There were\n11,000 more ballots than there were voters.\" Ellipse at GA 1134: \"11,600\nmore ballots and votes were counted, more than there were actual voters.\").\no Georgia\n\" There were more than 10,000 dead voters (Dalton at GA 1103: \"We were\nup. 10,315 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth\nmatches a Georgia resident who died in 2020 prior to the election.

Hundreds of illegal drop boxes were used (Dalton at GA 1105: \"In\nWisconsin over 90,000 ballots were illegally harvested. Can't do that. Not\nallowed to. Through so-called human drop boxes and over 500 illegal\nunmanned drop boxes were put out statewide.\" Ellipse at GA 1131: \"In\nWisconsin, corrupt Democrat-run cities deployed more than 500 illegal,\nunmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of 91,000\nunlawful votes.\"); and\n\u00b7 170,000 invalid absentee votes were counted (Dalton at GA 1105: \"Over\n170,000 absentee votes were counted that are blatantly illegal under\nWisconsin law and should never have been included in the tally.\" Ellipse\nat GA 1131: \"Over 170,000 absentee votes were counted in Wisconsin\nwithout a valid absentee ballot application. So they had a vote, but they had\nno application, and that's illegal in Wisconsin.\").\nThe defendant's language throughout the speech was that of a candidate focused on his re-\nelection. He claimed that he would not concede, that he received more votes than he had four\nyears earlier, that the election was over by 10:00 p.m. on election night, and that he wanted to go\n- 125 -\n\nPage 126:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 126 of 165\nback eight weeks to fix the election result. Significantly, he made many of these statements at the\nbeginning of the speech, framing the themes for the rest of the speech. 594\nIn addition, although countless federal, state, and local races also were on the same ballots\nas the defendant on election day-including those of every sitting member of the House of\nRepresentatives, even those on whom the defendant was counting to object at the congressional\nproceeding-the defendant focused only on his own race, the election for President, and only on\nallegations favoring him as a candidate in targeted states he had lost. 595 He claimed his \"election\nvictory\" was \"stolen,\" that he would not \"concede,\" and that \"with only three of the seven states\nin question, we win the presidency of the United States.\"596 He framed the claims of election fraud\nin terms of his own election and the margin of victory in his own race, and he spoke to his political\nsupporters using the pronoun \"we\"-showing that he was speaking not to all citizens, but only to\nhis own voters. 597\nFinally, the defendant repeatedly aimed accusations at Biden, his principal\nopponent in the election contest, as would a candidate. 598\nb. Tweets\nOne of the tools the defendant used for partisan political advantage-and in furtherance of\nthe charged conspiracies-was his personal Twitter account. He used his Twitter account to\nundermine public confidence in the electoral system, spread false claims of election fraud, attack\nthose speaking the truth that the defendant had lost the election, exhort supporters to travel to\nWashington for the certification proceeding, and marshal his supporters' anger at, and pressure on,\n594\nGA 1118-1119 (Ellipse Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/06/2021).\n595\nGA 1122, 1126-1136 (Ellipse Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/06/2021).\n596 GA 1115, 1122 (Ellipse Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/06/2021).\n597 GA 1115, 1132-1133, 1136 (Ellipse Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/06/2021).\n598 GA 1119, 1133, 1135 (Ellipse Rally Speech Draft Tr. 01/06/2021).\n- 126 -\n\nPage 127:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 127 of 165\nPence. As described below, an objective analysis of \"content, form, and context,\" id. at 2340,\nestablishes that the select Tweets that the Government intends to offer at trial were unofficial.\nAs an initial matter, the defendant sent, or directed the sending of, all Tweets and re-Tweets\nfrom @realDonaldTrump, the personal Twitter account that the defendant started long before\nassuming the presidency.599 The defendant began tweeting from @realDonaldTrump in May\n2009. Throughout his campaign for the presidency in 2016, the defendant used this Twitter\naccount for electioneering purposes; he even announced the selection of Pence as his Vice\nPresidential nominee over Twitter. 600 Since the end of his term in office, the defendant again has\nused the account for private purposes. During his presidential term, the defendant sometimes used\nthe @realDonaldTrump account to tweet about official business, including regarding COVID\nrelief and vaccines, legislation in Congress, and Executive Branch business. But he also regularly\nused the account to post on unambiguously private matters-for example, when he posted a picture\nof himself golfing with Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter,\nFlorida, and re-tweeted a Trump Organization post about the Trump New York hotel being \"named\nthe #1 'Best Hotel in the World!\"\",601\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Lindke v. Freed, 144 S. Ct. 756, 769 (2024), confirms\nthat a public official's personal social-media account can be used for both personal and public\nbusiness, and-consistent with Trump-that a fact-specific inquiry is required to discern into\nwhich category a post falls.

Simply because a Tweet relates to a matter of public concern does not\nautomatically transform it into an official communication. In Blassingame, 87 F.4th at 20, the\nD.C. Circuit rejected the defendant's contention that any and all of the President's communications\nare immune official acts whenever they involve a matter of public concern. The D.C. Circuit\nrecognized that the \"integrity of the 2020 election\" was a matter of public concern, but if the\ndefendant spoke about that issue \"in his personal capacity as a candidate for reelection rather than\nin his official capacity as President,\" it was unofficial speech not shielded by immunity. Id. Thus,\nwhen a court consults \"content and context\" to inform the official-act inquiry, see Trump, 144 S.\nCt. at 2340, a claim that all Tweets concerning election integrity were official must fail.\nAn analysis of the @realDonaldTrump account during the time period of the charged\nconspiracies demonstrates that the defendant frequently used the account to advance his unofficial\nobjectives as a candidate. Of the more than 1,200 Tweets, the vast majority were related to the\n2020 presidential election. For example, he announced over Twitter that\nCC1\nand others were\ntaking over his Campaign legal team, and he repeatedly used the platform to espouse false claims\nof election fraud and promote political rallies on his behalf. 602\nP45\nthe defendant's Deputy\nChief of Staff and the only person other than the defendant with control over the\n@realDonaldTrump Twitter account, acknowledged that he sometimes consulted with Campaign\npersonnel about material he was going to post on the account, that he worked as a volunteer for\nthe defendant's Campaign at the same time that he served as Deputy Chief of Staff, and that he did\n602\nGA 784-785 (Donald J.

The\ndefendant used this institutional account primarily to re-tweet other accounts like the\n@realDonaldTrump account, as well as @WhiteHouse. There were 74 Tweets from the\n@POTUS45 account during the charged conspiracies. 604 None of them include the defendant's\nelection-related claims or his election challenges.605 The last four Tweets in the account, which\nthe Government cites here to show context, were re-Tweets of Tweets from @realDonaldTrump\nregarding January 6.606 These include two Tweets that the defendant issued on the afternoon of\nJanuary 6 purportedly asking individuals to support law enforcement and \"stay\" peaceful; notably,\nthe @POTUS45 account archive does not include the defendant's Twitter pressure campaign\nagainst Pence, such as the 2:24 p.m. Tweet on January 6.607\nBelow, the Government analyzes the \"content, form, and context,\" id. at 2340, of various\ncategories of the defendant's Tweets.

See, e.g.,\nsupra p. 6. Just as his public statements casting doubt on the election were unofficial, so too were\nthe analogous Tweets that the defendant posted in his capacity as a candidate. The context of these\nTweets confirms this conclusion. The defendant issued the Tweets in advance of election day, in\nthe midst of his campaign for re-election; furthermore, he made them while his own Campaign\nadvisors were warning him that Biden supporters were much more likely to use mail-in voting, the\nvery method the defendant attempted to discourage. In addition, the Tweets' content further\nreinforces their private nature; they show the defendant taking a partisan electioneering position\non an issue rather than proposing any official measures to address a problem that the defendant\nclaimed existed.\nii.\nTweets making false claims of election fraud\nThe superseding indictment alleges that the defendant repeated and widely disseminated\nfalse claims of election fraud. See, e.g., Superseding Indictment, ECF No. 226 TT 12, 14. One of\nthe ways that he did so was by Tweet, constantly, day in and day out. Examples of the kinds of\nTweets that the Government intends to use at trial are set forth throughout Section I, in which the\ndefendant falsely claimed victory and outcome-determinative election fraud in targeted states. See,\ne.g., supra pp. 22-23, 32, 45, 55-56, 62-63.\nThese kinds of Tweets all shared common internal characteristics that establish their\nunofficial nature.

For instance, on December 23, the\ndefendant re-tweeted a Tweet by a Campaign surrogate named\nP70\nwho had posted a\nfacially fake White House memorandum titled \"Operation 'PENCE' CARD,\" which falsely\nclaimed that Pence could unilaterally disqualify legitimate electors. 634 The defendant issued\nsimilar Tweets as the certification grew closer, including posting on January 5 that \"[t]he Vice\nPresident has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.\"635 And twice on the morning of\nJanuary 6, before his speech at the Ellipse rally, the defendant tweeted again about Pence.

Through the\nTweets, the defendant was using the political pressure of his supporters and social media followers\nto convince Pence to take an action to benefit the defendant as a candidate and help him overturn\nthe results of the election. As discussed supra pp. 91-96, the defendant played no official role in\nthe congressional certification proceeding and was not using his Tweets about Pence's role to\nadvance any Executive Branch or governmental interest. Likewise, the defendant had no role in\nwhether state legislatures might take action regarding their own electoral slates (though his claim\nthat these legislatures were poised to do so was also false). And the defendant's language\nthroughout the Tweets is that of a candidate seeking to win an election, including stating to his\npolitical supporters that if Pence \"comes through for us, we will win the Presidency\" and \"All\nMike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN.\"638\nThe private and Campaign nature of the Tweets is further confirmed when viewed in the\ncontext of the defendant's increasing desperation as even his unlawful path to remain in power\nnarrowed.

USA demands the truth!\"641\nThe defendant's actions and knowledge in the hours leading up to this Tweet provide\nhelpful context. First, the evening before, on January 5, the defendant had dictated a Tweet to\nP45\nas he listened to the angry crowd gathered outside the White House. 642 That Tweet shows\nthat the defendant understood that his gathering supporters, who were angry and believed his false\nclaims that the election had been stolen, were a powder keg.

Our Country has had enough, they won't take it anymore!\nWe hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"643\nThereafter, the defendant continued to fixate on preventing the certification proceeding.\nAs described above, he tweeted about it at 1:00 a.m. on January 6 and again at 8:17 a.m. 644 After\n641 GA 946-947 (Donald J.

Upon receiving a phone\ncall alerting him that Pence had been taken to a secure location,\nP15\nrushed to the dining room to\ninform the defendant in hopes that the defendant would take action to ensure Pence's safety.\nInstead, after P15\ndelivered the news, the defendant looked at him and said only, \"So what?\"662\nThe private, unofficial nature of the 2:24 p.m. Tweet contrasts with two other Tweets the\ndefendant sent during the following hour and a video message he sent two hours later, and which\nthe Government does not intend to introduce at trial. Only after advisors had again urged the\ndefendant to calm matters at the Capitol, 663 the defendant at 2:38 p.m. posted, \"Please support our\nCapitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!\"664\nAs the violence at the Capitol nonetheless escalated, the defendant at 3:13 p.m. posted, \"I am\nasking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the\nParty of Law & Order-respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue.

Go home with love\n& in peace. Remember this day forever!\"667\nThe defendant at least has an argument-though he issued the 2:38 p.m. and 3:13 p.m.\nTweets only after being harangued by his staff while he adamantly refused to do anything at all-\nthat he was addressing a matter of public safety as President (the riot at the Capitol). Likewise, in\nthe 4:17 p.m. message, the defendant, while still focused on his election loss, asked rioters to\nevacuate the breached Capitol, and foreshadowed the sentiment in his 6:01 p.m. Tweet when he\nsaid to \"[g]o home with love & in peace.\"668 By contrast, in the 2:24 p.m. Tweet, the defendant\nfocused solely on the Vice President's role in the certification of the presidential election results\na matter of intense personal concern to the defendant as a candidate for office. Even assuming that\ntopic constituted a \"matter[] of public concern,\" Blassingame, 87 F.4th at 14, the defendant's 2:24\n666 GA 1952 (Video of Rose Garden Speech 01/06/2021); GA 1868 (Rose Garden Speech Draft\nTr. 01/06/2021).\n667 GA 952-953 (Donald J. Trump Tweet 01/06/2021).\n668 There are, however, strong arguments that all of these Tweets were unofficial. For example, in\nsome of them, the defendant misleadingly suggested that the already-violent crowd should \"[s]tay\"\nor \"remain\" \"peaceful\" while failing to urge or direct those unlawfully at the Capitol to leave, as\nhis advisors had urged him to do. He also used the messages to recognize the rioters at the Capitol\nas his own supporters, calling them \"WE\" and telling them that they were \"very special\" and that\nhe loved them. And even as early as the afternoon of January 6, when violence still raged at the\nCapitol, the defendant justified and revered the rioters' lawless actions on his behalf when he\ntweeted that \"[t]hese are the things and events that happen\" and to \"[r]emember this day forever!\"\n- 143 -\n\nPage 144:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 144 of 165\np.m. Tweet reflected speech made \"in an unofficial, private capacity as office-seeker, not an\nofficial capacity as office-holder.\" Id. at 5.\nGiven all of this context, the 2:24 p.m. Tweet was unofficial. When the defendant sent it,\nhe knew that what he had asked Pence to do, and that he claimed would \"protect our Country and\nour Constitution,\" was contrary to the ECA; that no state was poised to \"certify a corrected set of\nfacts;\" that a large crowd of his political supporters had gathered in Washington at his urging; that\nthese supporters were angry and believed his false claims that the election had been stolen; that he\nhad called them to action through his Ellipse speech, in which he told them that Pence might still\ndo as he wished and directed these supporters to march to the Capitol; and that his supporters had\ndone so and had breached the Capitol building.\nThe defendant also knew what his advisors were forcefully urging him to do as President:\nissue a message to quell the emergency at the Capitol. Instead, the defendant refused repeatedly\nuntil his advisors gave up and left him alone in the dining room. It was then that the defendant\nissued the 2:24 p.m. Tweet, as a candidate communicating to his angry supporters that Pence had\nlet him-and them-down. The content of the 2:24 p.m. Tweet was not a message sent to address\na matter of public concern and ease unrest; it was the message of an angry candidate upon the\nrealization that he would lose power. And unlike the defendant's later Tweets that day, the\ndefendant was not asking the individuals at the Capitol to \"remain peaceful,\" leave the building,\nor \"go home.\"\nc. Other public statements\nBy virtue of his status as a candidate for re-election, the defendant occasionally made\npublic statements-whether in response to questions or otherwise. Examples of such statements\nset forth in Section I are the defendant's statements in advance of the election to seed public doubt\nin the outcome (supra p. 6), the defendant's televised election night remarks to his supporters\n- 144 -\n\nPage 145:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 145 of 165\n(supra pp. 7-8), and the defendant's telephonic endorsement of\nCC1\nfalse allegations at the\nGettysburg \"hotel hearing\" (supra p. 39).\nEach of the defendant's cited public statements was made in his capacity as a candidate.\nHis pre-election statements, for instance, were made in contexts like the Republican National\nConvention or in the midst of statements about political polling. 669 His election night remarks\nwere made to a room of his supporters and were about his status as a candidate in the pending\nelection. 670\nAnd his contribution to the Gettysburg \"hotel hearing\" was to call in by dialing one\nof his private attorneys, who broadcast his personal message by holding her phone to the\nmicrophone so that he could make statements supporting those of his private attorneys. 671 In sum,\nthe defendant made all of these comments as a candidate for office, and was speaking about his\nown election. They were unofficial.\n2. In the alternative, any official portions of the defendant's public speeches,\nTweets, or statements should be excised\nAlternatively, if segregable portions of the speeches, Tweets, or statements are found to be\npresumptively immune official conduct, the first alternative would be to excise them from the\nspeeches, allowing the Government to rely on the unofficial statements in those speeches.\nThe D.C. Circuit has long recognized that district courts have \"discretionary power to\ndelete objectionable portions\" of evidence \"where appropriate,\" United States v. Lemonakis, 485\nF.2d 941, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1973), and the Supreme Court has approved of that practice in the context\nof statements that contain protected legislative acts along with unprotected acts under the\nConstitution's Speech or Debate Clause, see United States v. Helstoski, 442 U.S. 477, 488 n.7\n669 GA 1951 at 22:08-22:18 (Video of RNC Speech 08/24/2020); GA 1927 at 2:50-3:28 (Video\nof Donald J. Trump Statement 10/27/2020).\n670 GA 1974 (Video of White House Speech 11/04/2020).\n671 GA 1945 at 2:06:23-2:07:23 (Video of Pennsylvania Hotel Hearing 11/25/2020).\n- 145 -\n\nPage 146:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 146 of 165\n(1979) (approving practice of \"excising references to legislative acts, so that the remainder of the\nevidence would be admissible\"); see also Gov't of Virgin Islands v. Lee, 775 F.2d 514, 523 (3d\nCir. 1985) (\"even where a conversation includes a discussion of both legislative acts and non-\nlegislative acts, the conversation can be examined and the immunized aspects of the conversation\ndeleted\"). This is a familiar practice across a range of legal contexts. See, e.g., Samia v. United\nStates, 599 U.S. 635, 653 (2023) (upholding use of a redacted statement to avoid constitutional\nconcerns); Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 829 (2006) (\"Through in limine procedure, [trial\ncourts] should redact or exclude the portions of any statement that have become testimonial, as\nthey do, for example, with unduly prejudicial portions of otherwise admissible evidence.\"); In re\nRail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig. - MDL No. 1869, 34 F.4th 1, 13 (D.C. Cir. 2022)\n(relying on Lemonakis). Redaction of any statements ultimately found to be immune, while\nadmitting the significant remaining unofficial content, would resolve any constitutional questions\nunder Trump.\nTo the extent that excision does not resolve any arguable immunity claim, then even if the\ndefendant's conduct in these speeches, Tweets, and statements can be nudged across the line from\nCampaign conduct to official action, it is so heavily intertwined with Campaign-related conduct\nthat prosecuting it does not pose a danger to any Executive Branch function or authority. Because\nthe defendant bears the burden in the first instance of proving that conduct was official so as to\nqualify for presumptive immunity, the Government in its reply brief will address any specific\narguments the defense makes regarding the speeches, Tweets, and statements discussed here.\n- 146 -\n\nPage 147:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 147 of 165\nE. The Defendant's Interactions, in his Capacity as a Candidate, with White House\nStaff\n1. The interactions at issue were unofficial\nWhite House staffers witnessed or engaged in private, unofficial communications with the\ndefendant. These staffers included\nP9\nthe White House Senior Advisor who acted as a\nconduit between the defendant and the Campaign;\nP45\nand\nP7\nwho both volunteered for\nthe Campaign while working in the White House;\nP15\na staffer who witnessed a pertinent private\nremark by the defendant; and\nP42\nthe defendant's executive assistant.\nFederal law confirms that the defendant's Campaign-related conversations with these\nWhite House staffers were unofficial. The Hatch Act permits certain White House staffers to\nengage in political activity while on duty, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7324(a)(1), but prohibits them from using\ntheir \"official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an\nelection,\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7323(a)(1). These staffers can thus wear two hats. They can work in their\nprivate capacity to advance the interests of a political candidate, including while on official duty,\nor they can work in their official capacity to carry out Executive Branch responsibilities-but they\nmay not wear both hats at the same time. Accordingly, when the defendant's White House staff\nparticipated in political activity on his behalf as a candidate, they were not exercising their official\nauthority or carrying out official responsibilities. And when the President, acting as a candidate,\nengaged in Campaign-related activities with these officials or in their presence, he too was not\nengaging in official presidential conduct. 672\nPrecedent from the D.C. Circuit further confirms that the defendant was not engaging in\nofficial presidential conduct when he spoke with White House staffers about Campaign matters.\n672 Indeed, at least two of the witnesses-\nP9\nand\nP45\nconsulted with the White\nHouse Counsel's Office about their ability to engage with the Campaign, demonstrating that they\nunderstood their roles with respect to the Campaign were distinct from their White House roles.\n- 147 -\n\nPage 148:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 148 of 165\nIn In re Lindsey, 158 F.3d 1263, 1278-79 (D.C. Cir. 1998), the D.C. Circuit recognized that senior\nWhite House personnel may serve as the President's agents in a personal capacity to act as a\nconduit for unofficial information from a private party. The D.C. Circuit held that while the\nPresident's communications with his personal attorney are \"fully protected by the absolute\nattorney-client privilege,\" id. at 1283, a White House lawyer \"cannot rely on a government\nattorney-client privilege to shield evidence from the grand jury,\" id. at 1281. But a White House\nlawyer may invoke the President's personal attorney-client privilege when he acts as \"an\nintermediary\" to convey unofficial information from the President to his personal attorney. Id. As\nthe court explained, a President must often \"rely on aides\" to communicate with personal advisors,\nsuch as his personal attorneys, and the involvement of those aides does not alter the personal nature\nof the underlying communication. Id. at 1281-82. Similarly in this case, the transmission of a\nprivate Campaign communication by or to the defendant through a White House employee serving\nas an intermediary did not render that communication official and thereby shield it from use in a\ncriminal trial against the defendant.\nIn sum, just as the President can at times act \"in an unofficial capacity\"-including as \"a\ncandidate for office or party leader,\" Trump, 144 S. Ct. at 2340-so too can the Executive Branch\nstaff around him. Simply because a staffer holds a title in the Executive Branch and interacts with\nthe President does not mean that the interaction is necessarily official. See Blassingame, 87 F.4th\nat 14 (noting \"the settled understanding that immunity is based on 'the nature of the function\nperformed, not the identity of the actor who performed it.\"\" (quoting Clinton, 520 U.S. at 695)).\nWhen the individuals listed below interacted with the defendant in the circumstances described in\nSection I, those conversations were unofficial.\n- 148 -\n\nPage 149:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 149 of 165\na.\nP9\nFrom August 2020 through the end of the defendant's administration,\nP9\nwas an\nAssistant to the President without a defined portfolio. 673\nMore importantly for the Court's\npurposes, during the charged conspiracies,\nP9\nserved as a conduit of information from\nthe Campaign to the defendant and discussed Campaign matters with the defendant. These actions\nwere, consistent with In re Lindsey, unofficial.\nAs part of its immunity analysis, the Court should consider multiple different interactions\ninvolving\nP9\nnone of which bear on his official White House responsibilities: (1) a\nNovember 13 phone call in which the defendant told\nP9\nhe was going to put\nCC1\nin\ncharge of the Campaign's legal efforts under an agreement where the defendant only would pay if\nCC1\nwere successful, and\nP9\nguaranteed the defendant he never would have to pay\n(supra pp. 11-12); (2) a November conversation with the defendant regarding\nCC3\n(supra\nfraud allegations\np. 44); (3) an undated conversation in which he told the defendant that\nCC1\ncould never be proved in court and the defendant responded, \"the details don't matter\" (supra\nP9\npp. 12-13); (4) a November or December 2020 conversation in which\nexplained to\nthe defendant why one of his fraud claims was \"bullshit\" (supra p. 13); (5) a late December\nexchange with the defendant regarding the verification\nCC2\nwanted him to sign in Trump v.\nP9\nCC2\n(ECF\nKemp (supra p. 27); (6) a January 4, 2021, conversation\nhad with\nNo. 226 | 77; supra p. 66), after which Herschman reported to the defendant that\nCC2\nadmitted his plan was \"not going to work\" (supra p. 66); and (7) a variety of occasions on which\nhad\nP9\nreported to the defendant that his Campaign and its hired experts had found various\nelection fraud claims to be unsupported (supra p. 12).\n673 GA 671\n- 149 -\n\nPage 150:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 150 of 165\nSection I also includes actions by\nP9\nthat do not reflect any presidential conduct\nbecause the defendant was not involved. These include December 3 text messages that\nP9\nexchanged with\nP21\nregarding\nCC1\nfalse fraud claims at a Georgia\nlegislative hearing (ECF No. 226 | 26(a); supra pp. 21-22), and December 13 text messages\nP9\nexchanged with Campaign personnel regarding the fraudulent elector scheme (ECF\nNo. 226 | 60; supra pp. 52-53).\nThe content of each of\nP9\ncommunications with the defendant enumerated\nabove involve the defendant's Campaign, including the status and viability of the defendant's fraud\nclaims, the quality of the advice the defendant was receiving from his Campaign advisors, his\nlitigation and electoral prospects, and the legality and practicality of\nCC2\nproposal that Pence\nreject Biden's legitimate electors at the certification proceeding. None of the communications\npertain to general election policy issues or considerations, Justice Department criminal\ninvestigations, Executive Branch functions, or any other presidential responsibilities.\nAs context for all these communications, the Court should consider\nP9\nrelationship with the defendant, his role in the White House, and his interactions with the\nCampaign.\nP9\nrelationship with the defendant and his family pre-existed his position\nin the White House, and\nP9\nrepresented the defendant in his impeachment trial.\nP9\ndid not have a defined portfolio, and worked on matters related to the Justice\nDepartment, including the Portland riots and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as\nwell as Middle East issues and pardons. 674\nThe Government does not intend to elicit specific\ninformation about communications\nP9\nhad with the defendant regarding his official\nduties.\n674 GA 671, 697 (\n; GA 700\n- 150 -\n\nPage 151:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 151 of 165\nP9\nwas not acting in an official capacity during the conversations enumerated\nabove, but as a conduit for information from the Campaign.\nP9\ncontact with the\nCampaign began in October 2020, when he asked Campaign staffers\nP3\nand\nP72\nfor a tutorial on campaign basics and operations. 675 He continued to talk to\nP3\nand\nP72\nleading up to the election to understand different electoral college win/loss scenarios. 676 Shortly\nthereafter, in early November 2020\nP9\nasked\nP77\nwho handled ethics issues in\nthe White House Counsel's Office, for permission to engage with the Campaign, and thereafter\nP9\nbegan frequent contact with Campaign staff. 677\nSeveral days after the election,\nP9\nwent to the Campaign headquarters in Virginia for the first time, while\nP2\nCC1\nP56\nCC3\nP10\nP48\nand P12\nwere there too.678 As discussed supra\np. 9, on November 7-likely the same day he went to the Campaign headquarters-\nP9\nP3\nand\nP4\nat the White House to discuss with\njoined Campaign staffers, including\nP2\nthe defendant the fact that networks that morning had projected Biden as the winner of the\nelection. 679\nThe Campaign staff and\nP9\ntold the defendant his chance of victory was\nslim. 680\nP9\nalso participated in various Oval Office meetings with the defendant, Pence,\nWhite House staff, Campaign officials, and\nP39\n681\nThe defendant heard and mentioned, to\nP9\nand others, various fraud allegations\nthroughout the post-election period, sometimes from his outside attorneys like\nCC1\no\u013e\nCC3\n675 GA 671-672\n676 GA 672-673\n677 GA 673, 686\n678 GA 673\n679\nGA 194-195\n680 GA 196-197\n681 See, e.g., GA 683-684\n- 151 -\n\nPage 152:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 152 of 165\nConsistent with this,\nP9\nasked\nP3\nand\nP72\nif certain fraud allegations were\naccurate, so that he could challenge information provided to the defendant by people like\nCC1\nCC3\nand\nP12 682\nP9\nalso began interacting on a near-daily basis with\nP22\na\nCampaign staffer who\nP73\ntold\nP9\nhe could trust. 683\nThe Campaign, in turn,\nhired two outside firms-\nC1\nand\nC2\nto investigate fraud allegations. 684\nP9\ntold the defendant that people external to the Campaign were hired to look into fraud allegations. 685\nOverall,\nP9\nserved as a conduit of day-to-day information between\nP22\nand\nthe defendant during the post-election period.\nP22\ntestified that around the time that\nCC1\nwas named to lead legal efforts, \"I was introduced to\nP9\nand I started\npredominately reporting to\nP9\n686\nHe elaborated that\nP9\n\"started to call\nme more and more.

The defendant was asking for\nP9\nview on various strategic decisions he was making regarding his Campaign and his private\nattorneys, and he was getting reports from\nP9\non information related to actual and\npotential election challenges important to his candidacy and private Campaign. All of this context\nestablishes both that\nP9\nwore two hats-one official, one private-and that the defendant\ninteracted with\nP9\nin these conversations as a candidate rather than as President.

General information\nabout access to the defendant's Twitter account, as well as\nP45\n's testimony that\nP45\ndid\nor did not issue a particular Tweet, is unrelated to any particular official act by the defendant.\nc.\nP7\nP7\nwas an Assistant to the President and a volunteer for the Campaign.697 She will\ntestify about two specific sets of conversations: (1) a handful of conversations in which the\ndefendant, in advance of the election, said that he would simply declare victory (supra p. 5); and\n694 GA 526\n695 GA 528-529\n696 GA 527 (\n); GA 545\n697 GA 241-244 (\n- 154 -\n\nPage 155:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 155 of 165\n(2) an unprompted statement in which the defendant remarked, in a private moment, that\nCC3\nclaims were \"crazy\" (supra p. 44).\nRegarding the pre-election conversations,\nP7\nhas testified that COVID's expected effect\non the election, and in particular the anticipated phenomenon that the defendant would take an\nearly lead in some states based on the election day vote that would dissipate as mail-in ballots were\ncounted, was discussed among Campaign personnel and dual-hat White House staffers who\nsimultaneously volunteered for the Campaign. 698 In that context, the defendant told\nP7\nand\nothers words to the effect of, \"We'll just declare victory.\"699 Regarding the defendant's statement\nabout\nCC3\nP7\nwill testify about a November 20 phone call in which the defendant mocked\nand laughed at\nCC3\nand called her allegations-that he adopted and amplified-\"crazy.\"700\nIn all of these interactions, the defendant was interacting as a candidate with\nP7\nnot as\nPresident. With respect to his pre-election comments about declaring victory, the context of the\nconversations indicates that the defendant was responding in real time to information that\nCampaign staff provided him on private matters. Similarly, the November 20 conversation among\nthe defendant,\nP7\nand\nP45\nregarding\nCC3\nwas also a Campaign conversation.\nP7\nP45\nand\ntwo staffers who volunteered for the Campaign while working in the White House,\nwere informally discussing with the defendant developments in his Campaign-namely that one\nof his private attorneys had been a source of public embarrassment. The defendant then dialed his\nprivate attorney,\nCC3\nand made the comment about her claims with her on the muted phone\nline. The defendant was not seeking advice from White House staffers; he was making fun of his\nprivate attorney in the presence of Campaign volunteers.\n698\nGA 246-249\n699 GA 250-253\n700 GA 258\n- 155 -\n\nPage 156:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 156 of 165\nc.\nP15\nP15\nwas an Assistant to the President and Director of Oval Office Operations.701 At trial,\nthe Government will elicit from P15\nthat he witnessed an unprompted comment that the defendant\nmade to his family members in which the defendant suggested that he would fight to remain in\npower regardless of whether he had won the election. Specifically, following the 2020 election\nwhile aboard Marine One, the defendant told his wife, daughter\nP14\nand son-in-law\nP13\n\"It doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.\"\nSee supra p. 14-15.702\nP15\nhappened to overhear this comment, but was not participating in the\nconversation. 703\nThis statement is plainly private. It was exclusively about the election and the defendant's\ndetermination, as a candidate, to remain in power whether he won or lost. The defendant made\nthe comment to his family members, who campaigned on his behalf and served as private advisors\n(in addition to any official role they may have played). The fact that it was overheard by\nP15\na\nWhite House staffer, does not convert it to an official communication.\nd.\nP42\nTo a limited extent, the allegations in the superseding indictment and the Government's\nevidence involve\nP42\nthe defendant's executive assistant in the White House. Section I\ndescribes multiple instances in which\nP42\nreceived emails intended for the defendant or sent\nemails on the defendant's behalf. These instances include:\nP42\nsending to a group of private\nCC3\nattorneys, including\nan email with the subject \"From POTUS\" directing the private\nattorneys to include material critical of\nC3\nin private lawsuits (see supra\n701 GA 307\n); GA 304-305\n702 GA 308\n).\n703 GA 309\nD-\n- 156 -\n\nPage 157:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 157 of 165\npp. 42);\nP42\nreceiving from\nCC1\nan email for the defendant providing a copy of the\nmessage\nCC1\nhad drafted to exert pressure on Michigan Senate Majority Leader\nP37\n(see\nsupra p. 34);\nP42\nreceiving from\nP39\nthe RNC's \"Elector Recap\" email to put in front\nof the defendant (see supra p. 57); and\nP42\nreceiving an email from\nCC2\non December 23\nasking to update the defendant on \"overall strategic thinking\" on the defendant's status as a\ncandidate (see supra p. 61).\nNone of these actions by\nP42\nin which she was merely facilitating communications\nbetween the defendant and his private attorneys or private political allies, constitute the\ndefendant's official conduct.\nP42\nregularly facilitated the defendant's purely private matters,\nincluding communications with his children about his Thanksgiving travel.704 The defendant's\nreliance on\nP42\nto pass messages to and from personal advisors, friends, and family does not\nrender the underlying private communications official. See Lindsey, 158 F.3d at 1281-82.\n2. Even if this evidence were deemed official, the Government could rebut any\npresumption of immunity\nEven if an \"official\" gloss were applied to the defendant's conversations with White House\nstaff pertaining solely to the President's chances as a candidate to successfully challenge the\nelection results, the use of such evidence would not intrude on Executive Branch functions or\nauthority. \"The Office of the Presidency as an institution is agnostic about who will occupy it\nnext.\" Blassingame, 87 F.4th at 4.

The Supreme Court\nrequired that its rebuttal analysis focus on Executive Branch authority and functions-not merely\non anything that the President might say or do while at the White House. Here, the Executive\nBranch has no authority or function in the certification of the next President. Accordingly, the use\nof evidence of White House staffers' Campaign-capacity discussions with the President about how\nto challenge state election results-challenges brought in his capacity as a candidate-does not\nrisk impairing the constitutional role of the Executive Branch.\nF. Other Evidence of the Defendant's Knowledge and Intent\nThe Government intends to introduce at trial additional evidence to prove the defendant's\nknowledge and intent. These include (1) public statements by federal officials that the defendant\ndid not direct be made (specifically, public statements by Attorney General\nP52\nand CISA\nDirector\nP50\nabout the lack of election fraud and foreign interference); (2) evidence that the\ndefendant was reviewing Twitter and watching television throughout the afternoon of January 6;\nand (3) the defendant's post-Administration statements. None of this evidence will involve\ntestimony from the defendant's Executive Branch staff about his official actions.\n1. The evidence at issue was unofficial\na. Statements by federal officials\ni.\nP52\n(supra p. 46)\nIn a public statement issued on December 1, 2020, Attorney General P52\nsaid that the\nDepartment of Justice had not seen evidence of fraud sufficient to change the election results, and\n- 158 -\n\nPage 159:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 159 of 165\nthat claims that voting machines had skewed election results were unsubstantiated. 705\nP52 decided\nto make his statement without informing the defendant in advance.706 He prepared the statement\nbecause he had been watching the defendant repeat claims of election fraud publicly despite direct\nknowledge, from\nP52\nand others, that they were false, and\nP52\nwas growing more and more\nfrustrated by the defendant's actions. 707 On November 29, P52\nsaw the defendant appear on the\nMaria Bartiromo Show and claim, among other false things, that the Justice Department was\n\"missing in action\" and had ignored evidence of fraud. 708\nP52\ndecided it was time to speak\npublicly in contravention of the defendant's false claims, set up a lunch with a reporter for the\nAssociated Press, and made his statement-all without informing or seeking permission from the\ndefendant. The same day, on behalf of the Campaign,\nCC1\nand P12\nissued a statement\nattacking\nP52\nfor his comments. 709\nIn the days that followed,\nP1\nacknowledged and\ncriticized\nP52\nstatement during his podcast, asking rhetorically \"is\nP52\nreading the same\nthings we're reading?\" and prompting guest\nCC6\nto comment that \"the DOJ has not been\nfollowing up on these leads as far as we know right now. That statement seemed to be very\npremature.\n[T]here's no way one can look at this election in these states and say that it was\ndone properly.\"710\nP52\nstatement is not an official act by the defendant. Trump treats only the defendant's\nown acts as potentially immune, see, e.g., 144 S. Ct. at 2338, consistent with the \"justifying\npurposes of the immunity\"-\"to ensure that the President can undertake his constitutionally\n705 GA 1242-1243 (Email from Comms Alert 12/01/2020).\n706 GA 12-13\n707 GA 8-10\n708\nGA 10\n709 GA 1244 (Trump Campaign Press Release 12/01/2020).\n710 GA 1978 at 11:56-12:04, 32:06-33:16\n- 159 -\n\nPage 160:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 160 of 165\ndesignated functions effectively, free from undue pressures or distortions,\" id. at 2332 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The immunity that the Supreme Court recognized thus does not imply\nthat acts by other government officials can qualify as presidential acts. More to the point,\nP52\nstatement does not reveal any official action by the defendant because\nP52\ndid not give his public\nstatement at the defendant's direction or even with his knowledge. To the contrary, if the defendant\nhad been aware of what P52\nintended to do he undoubtedly would have instructed P52\nnot to\nmake the statement; when the defendant learned of\nP52\nstatement, he was so angry that P52\ntendered his resignation and, momentarily, the defendant accepted-until\nP9\nand\nP59\nprevailed upon the defendant to calm down and convinced P52\nto delay his departure. 711\nThe Government does not intend to introduce evidence that implies that P52\nor his deputies refuted\nthe defendant's fraud claims to him directly; instead, the Government intends to introduce\nP52\nstatement and\nCC1\nCampaign response to it, as well as\nP1\nrecognition and repetition\nof P52\nstatement.\nii.\nP50\n(supra pp. 42-43)\nOn November 17, CISA Director\nP50\ntweeted a link to an open letter by 59 election\nsecurity experts and touted it in an effort to promote public confidence in the election's\ninfrastructure. 712 This was similar to what\nP50\nhad done five days earlier on November 12,\nwhen he had publicized the joint statement CISA issued with the National Association of\nSecretaries of State, the National Association of State Election Directors, and other organizations\ndeclaring the 2020 election to be \"the most secure in American history\" and that there was \"no\nevidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way\n711 GA 107-113\n); GA 115-119\n712 GA 790 (Tweet 11/17/2020).\n- 160 -\n\nPage 161:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 161 of 165\ncompromised.\"713 On November 17,\nP50\npromoted the expert report on his own initiative and,\nas he later learned, contrary to the defendant's wishes; the defendant promptly fired\nP50\nthe\nsame day, by Tweet.714 The Government does not intend to introduce any evidence about the\ndefendant's removal of\nP50\nRather, as with\nP52\npublic statement,\nP50\npublic Tweets\nwere not official actions by the defendant and thus are not protected by presidential immunity.\nb. The defendant's use of Twitter and television on January 6 (Superseding\nIndictment, ECF No. 226 | 92; supra p. 79)\nForensic evidence from the defendant's iPhone and observations by witnesses otherwise\ntestifying about unofficial acts will establish that upon his return from the Ellipse, throughout the\nafternoon on January 6, the defendant sat in the dining room by the Oval Office, where he used his\nphone to review Twitter and watched the television, which was turned on and displaying news\ncoverage of the riot at the Capitol.715\nAs explained in the Government's expert notice, ECF No. 183, an FBI Computer Analysis\nResponse Team forensic examiner can testify as to the news and social media applications\ndownloaded on the defendant's phone, 716 and can describe the activity occurring on the phone\nthroughout the afternoon of January 6.717 The phone's activity logs show that the defendant was\nusing his phone, and in particular, using the Twitter application, consistently throughout the day\nafter he returned from the Ellipse speech. 718\n713 GA 779 (Tweet 11/12/2020); GA 1236-1237 (Election Security Joint Statement 11/12/2020).\n714 GA 791-794 (Donald J.

In turn, the Government will introduce the\nauthenticated coverage showing what Fox News was playing in real time while the defendant sat\nin the room with the television on. This evidence is particularly relevant to the defendant's\nknowledge at the time he issued the 2:24 p.m. Tweet, which, as described above, was unofficial.\nNone of this evidence involves testimony about an act by the defendant at all, and it shows\nwhat social media and news the defendant privately reviewed in service of issuing a private Tweet.\nThe Government will not elicit testimony from the defendant's staffers about his official\ndeliberations, reactions to social media or television, or official actions taken in response. The\ndefendant's review of social media and television news-under these particular circumstances-\n-\nwas no different from that of any other citizen or candidate and therefore was unofficial.\nc. The defendant's post-Administration statements (supra pp. 81, 83)\nAs the Government identified in its Rule 404(b) notice, ECF No. 174-1 at 8-9, the\nGovernment will introduce some of the defendant's numerous statements that post-date his time\nas President in which he has blamed Pence and approved of the actions of his supporters who\nbreached the Capitol and obstructed the certification proceeding, 722 thus providing evidence of his\nintent on January 6.\n719 GA 232-236\n720 GA 318\n).\n721 GA 541-543\n722\nSee, e.g., GA 1970 at 17:37 (Video of Trump Interview 07/10/2021); GA 1926 at 1:15:30\n- 162 -\n\nPage 163:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 163 of 165\nThe defendant's endorsement of the violent actions of his supporters on January 6, and his\nsentiment that they were justified in threatening Pence-all made while the defendant was a private\ncitizen after the end of his term in office-are probative of his intent during the charged\nconspiracies. The Government intends to offer them as evidence of the defendant's intent on\nJanuary 6, not as evidence of his official acts.\n2. Even if this evidence were deemed official, the Government could rebut any\npresumption of immunity\nThe use of the evidence regarding former Attorney General P52\nand CISA Director\nP50\nwould not intrude on Executive Branch authority or functions because the federal officials'\nstatements reflected those officials' positions, knowledge, and expertise-not presidential acts or\ndirection. The President is the \"the only person who alone composes a branch of government,\"\nTrump, 144 S. Ct. at 2329 (citation omitted), but Congress structures the Executive Branch and\nassigns manifold specific duties to subordinate officers who in turn execute the law.

Put concretely, allowing these\nindependent acts of Executive Branch officials to be used in the prosecution would not chill any\nPresidential conduct, and thus any presumption of immunity is overcome.\nThe same is true for testimony by White House staff about the President's review of Twitter\nor his watching public events on television. Assuming for the moment that the President\nsometimes acts in an official capacity when watching television or reviewing Twitter, no statute\nor constitutional provision addresses the matter, and using evidence of his activity that virtually\nall citizens engage in-i.e., checking their social-media feeds and watching television-does not\nintrude on any authority or functions of the Executive Branch.\nIV.\nConclusion\nBased on a \"factbound analysis,\" for the reasons explained above, the Court should\ndetermine that the conduct described in the factual proffer of Section I of this motion is not subject\nto presidential immunity. As part of this determination, the Court should specify four\ndeterminations, and do so in a single order: (1) that the Government has rebutted the presumption\nof immunity attached to the defendant's official communications with the Vice President (see\nsupra pp. 49, 63-67, 77-74; ECF No. 226 ||| 11(c), 67, 70-78, 80, 82, and 84); and (2) that the\nremaining conduct described in Section I (that is, conduct other than the official communications\nwith the Vice President) was not official, and, in the alternative, that the Government has rebutted\nany presumptive immunity for any of the remaining conduct that the Court finds to be official.\nThe Government requests alternative rulings regarding rebuttal for all conduct the Court finds to\nbe unofficial, to buttress the Court's record, ensure thorough and efficient appellate review, and\nminimize the risk of successive rounds of interlocutory appeal.\n- 164 -\n\nPage 165:\nCase 1:23-cr-00257-TSC Document 252 Filed 10/02/24 Page 165 of 165\nFurthermore, based on the determination that all the conduct described in Section I is not\nimmune from prosecution, and because Section I encompasses all the allegations in the\nsuperseding indictment, the Court should further specify: (3) that the defendant is subject to trial\non the superseding indictment; and (4) that the Government is not prohibited at trial from using\nevidence of the conduct described in Section I, subject at a later date to non-immunity based\nobjections and this Court's admissibility rulings under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJACK SMITH\nSpecial Counsel\n/s/ Molly Gaston\nMolly Gaston\nThomas P.
